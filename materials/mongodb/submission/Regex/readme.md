<h1 align=center>Customer Analysis System with CRUD Operations</h1>
<p align='justify'> Data science is a field of science that studies how to extract knowledge and insights from data using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems. Data science can be used to create customer analysis systems capable of collecting, storing, analysing, and visualising customer data. Customer analysis is the process of gathering, analysing, and interpreting data about customers in order to gain insights into their behaviour and preferences. This data can then be used to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. The system in this assignment is built using MongoDB, MySQL, and PHP. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that can store and query large amounts of unstructured data. MySQL is a relational database designed for storing and querying structured data. PHP is a scripting language that can be used to create web applications on the server.There are several steps to develop the customer analyze system which is designing the system, setting up the development environment, implementing CRUD operations with MongoDB and MySQL, writing PHP scripts to preprocess and analyse the data, and creating a web interface.</p>
