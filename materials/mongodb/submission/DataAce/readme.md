<h3>Introduction</h3>

A Student Management System is a vital application for educational institutions to organize student information. PHP and MongoDB provide an efficient combination for developing such a system. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, offers flexibility and scalability, while PHP serves as the server-side scripting language. By establishing a connection to the MongoDB server using the MongoClient class, we perform CRUD operations on the student data. We can create new student records, retrieve and display student information, update existing records, and delete records when necessary. By following the principles of Create, Read, Update, and Delete, we developed a functional Student Management System to insert details of student.

<h3> Features </h3>

- Create: Add new student records with details such as name, age, and major.
- Read: Retrieve and display student information from the database.
- Update: Modify existing student records to update their information.
- Delete: Remove student records from the system.

<h3> Prerequisites </h3>

To run the Student Management System, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- PHP (version 7 or above)
- MongoDB
- Composer (for dependency management)

<h3> Insights from the project </h3>

The Student Management System project using PHP and MongoDB offers several learning opportunities. By working on this project, you can gain hands-on experience in integrating a NoSQL database (MongoDB) with PHP, performing CRUD operations, and manipulating data. Additionally, you will develop skills in web application development using PHP, including handling HTTP requests, rendering dynamic web pages, and processing form submissions. Through the use of Composer for dependency management, you can learn how to incorporate third-party libraries into your project. Moreover, you will practice code organization, adhere to best practices, and tackle problem-solving challenges. Overall, this project helps you strengthen your PHP and MongoDB proficiency while improving your skills in web development, database integration, and problem-solving.
