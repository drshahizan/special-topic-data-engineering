# Flickr
Flickr is a popular online photo-sharing platform and social networking site that allows users to upload, organize, and share their photos and videos. It was created in 2004 by Ludicorp, a Canadian company, and acquired by Yahoo! in 2005. In 2018, Flickr was acquired by SmugMug, a photo-sharing and image hosting service.

Flickr allows users to upload and share their photos and videos with others, either publicly or privately. Users can organize their photos into albums, add tags to make them searchable, and explore and discover other users' photos through the platform's social features, including groups and communities.

One of the key features of Flickr is its Creative Commons licensing, which allows users to share their photos and videos with others while retaining control over how they are used. This has made Flickr a popular resource for bloggers, journalists, and others who need high-quality images for their work.

Flickr offers both free and paid accounts, with the paid accounts offering additional features such as unlimited storage, ad-free browsing, and advanced statistics. The platform has also released mobile apps for iOS and Android devices, allowing users to upload and share photos on the go.

Flickr remains a popular and influential platform for photographers and photo enthusiasts, offering a robust set of features for sharing and discovering high-quality images.

## Extract data
To extract images and metadata related to cats from Flickr, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Flickr website: https://www.flickr.com/
2. In the search bar, enter the keyword "cat" and click on the search button.
3. On the search results page, click on the "Advanced search" button to the right of the search bar.
4. In the advanced search form, you can further refine your search by specifying criteria such as the type of media (photos, videos, etc.), date range, license, etc. For example, to search for only photos with a Creative Commons license, you can select "Photos" in the "Media type" field and choose "Creative Commons" in the "License" field.
5. After specifying your search criteria, click the "Search" button to retrieve the results.
6. You can then extract the relevant metadata for the images using web scraping techniques. This can be done using programming languages such as Python and libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.
7. Some of the metadata that can be extracted for Flickr images include the image URL, title, description, date uploaded, number of views, and tags. You can also extract the actual image files using the image URLs.
8. Once you have extracted the data, you can store it in a database such as MongoDB or export it to a CSV file for further analysis.
