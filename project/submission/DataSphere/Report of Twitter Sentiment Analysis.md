## Background
<p align="justify">
The sentiment analysis project focused on analyzing mental health-related discussions and sentiments expressed on Twitter. Twitter serves as a valuable platform for individuals to share their thoughts, experiences, and emotions related to mental health. By scraping and analyzing tweets from Twitter, this project aimed to gain insights into the sentiment and attitudes surrounding mental health topics on the platform.

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and it has garnered increased attention in recent years. Understanding the sentiments expressed by individuals on social media platforms like Twitter provides a unique opportunity to explore public perceptions, experiences, and reactions to mental health issues.

By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, this project sought to uncover important insights. These insights include identifying prevalent sentiment trends, understanding the emotional impact of specific mental health topics, detecting influential or viral tweets, and observing how sentiment evolves over time. These findings can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of public sentiment towards mental health, help identify areas where support may be lacking, and inform efforts aimed at destigmatizing mental health and promoting well-being.

The data for this project was collected using web scraping techniques, specifically utilizing tools such as Snscrape to retrieve tweets based on mental health-related keywords or hashtags. The collected tweets were then preprocessed, removing irrelevant information and normalizing the text, before being subjected to sentiment analysis algorithms.
