There are several different parts of skeleton remains and every part contains several features. However, not all features can contribute to gender classification in forensic anthropology. Besides that, another limitation that exists in previous researches is the absence of parameter optimization for the classifier. Thus, this paper proposed metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Algorithm and Harmony Search Algorithm based feature selection to identify the most significant features of skeleton remains. Once the set of significant features was obtained, the learning rate and momentum of Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) were optimized. This was to obtain a good combination of parameters in order to produce a better gender classification. This study used 1,538 data samples from Goldman Osteometric Dataset which consisted of femur, humerus and tibia parts. Based on the feature selection results, the Optimized BPNN outperformed other methods for all datasets. The Ant Colony Algorithm-Optimized Back Propagation Neural Network produced the highest accuracy for all parts of the skeleton where for femur was 89.44%, the humerus with 88.97% and tibia with 87.52% accuracy.

We consider independent task models that are subject to deadline constraints specified using step time/utility functions (or TUFs). The basic idea of our algorithm is to reduce the number of unnecessary abortion that occurs in GUS by preemption instead of abortion. We consider the scheduling objective of maximizing the utility that is accrued by the completion of all tasks. Simulation results revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms GUS algorithm. By reducing the total number of task aborted together with lower abortion ratio, this in effect produced a higher utility and reduced the average response time, making it more suitable and efficient in time-critical application domain.",7.0

Estimating missing values is an undeniable scenario faced by field experts. The imputation method is an effective way to impute the proper values to proceed with the next process in microarray technology. Missing value imputation methods may increase the classification accuracy. Although these methods might predict the values, classification accuracy rates prove the ability of the methods to identify the missing values in gene expression data. In this study, a novel method, Optimised Hybrid of Fuzzy C-Means and Majority Vote (opt-FCMMV), was proposed to identify the missing values in the data. Using the Majority Vote (MV) and optimisation through Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), this study predicted missing values in the data to form more informative and solid data. In order to verify the effectiveness of opt-FCMMV, several experiments were carried out on two publicly available microarray datasets (ie Ovary and Lung Cancer) under three missing value mechanisms with five different percentage values in the biomedical domain using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

The varied approaches can be integrated to ensure that the right knowledge can be created, captured, stored, and disseminated. In addition, managing both explicit and tacit knowledge will enable knowledge in individuals to be transferred and shared for new knowledge to be created, further expanded and embodying it quickly in new products and services, technologies and systems. One of the perspectives on knowledge management which is given much emphasis is the Japanese perspectives that focuses on cultural behavioural approach. This paper explains how the theory of knowledge conversion can be an influential element in knowledge management initiatives programmes. Another area that requires much attention is the tool and enabler that includes the application of technology and resources to enhance content intelligence to expedite access and reuse of the knowledge captured and stored. On the contrary, this paper highlighted on the issue whether access itself will have a substantial impact on business performance especially as mountains of new information are placed online. To address such issue, organizations need to consider the systematic approach that do not merely focus on process and technology. Thus, the cultural behavioural aspect of knowledge management discussed in great length is integrated into the knowledge management system architecture which is designed, based on the fact that knowledge management relies heavily on human intellectual effort and skills.",3.0

Therefore, we propose an energy-saving scheme for use in wireless sensor networks and this the goal of this Research. The proposed protocol is a mixture of the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and mediation device (MD) protocols. It combines the advantages of both. The suggested protocol includes a mechanism for avoiding the collisions that exist in the MD protocols. Also, it allows the cluster head to be in sleep mode if there is no data to be sent.(In addition, MD Device in the proposed protocol will send ID to the node which will send the data to the cluster head that avoid collision signals that unfortunately happen in MD protocols and know which node sent data). This is in contrast to the LEACH protocol and MD protocol, where the cluster head is always switched on. Placing the cluster head in sleep mode contributes to reducing energy consumption. In the proposed scheme, clustering is used as in LEACH, but the cluster head is asleep by default. However, when a sensor node has data to send, it informs the MD, which then awakens the cluster head, making it ready for receiving sensor data. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we suggest a mathematical model that estimates the energy that the scheme saves as compared with LEACH. The results show that substantial energy saving is possible when the cluster head can be placed in sleep mode for a large percentage of time. Intuitively, this time percentage is higher when sensors have less data to send.",1.0

Classification Students’ Attention in E-learning Using Machine Learning,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4320161,"Eman Attallah Aljabarti, Mohd Shahizan Othman",2023,Available at SSRN 4320161,,,,,,"Remarkable progress is being made in straddling the boundaries between the actual and the virtual worlds. Computers have become an essential aspect of everyday life as more and more people use them to complete a wide range of jobs, from online learning to shopping. When a user's level of involvement with the system (s) he is dealing with is recognized, the system's response to the user may be altered. As a result, e-learning benefits from cheaper costs and greater value. Machine learning is one of the goals of educational research that focuses on learning behavior analysis. It's a goal of e-learning to help students overcome the downsides of e-learning environments, such as prone inattention during the class, which can degrade student productivity and outcomes. Teachers can get quick feedback and make adaptive adaptations to meet the requirements of their students when they can accurately forecast their engagement. Researchers have made great strides in the field, yet many of their methods rely on the inefficient feature extraction methods or learn global features. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, we provide a new method for detecting student involvement in this work, called Local-SVM. The local feature extraction is done using the MoveNet model, which selects 17 unique key-points and extracts their values. The proposed model is assessed on the DAiSEE dataset and compared to K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and existing state-of-the-art techniques. This strategy outperforms the competitors by a wide margin, according to evaluation matrices and expert feedback.",

The proposed method introduces a theoretical formalism that translates the discernibility relations of classes in a decision system into the SAT problem. The SAT representation is then formulated as an Integer Programming (1P) model called SAT_IP to solve the minimal reduct computation problem. First, a set of rules is generated from the reducts and these will then be used to solve the classification problem. The method generates a minimum set of rules, which are shorter in length, and there is also greater accuracy in the classification. 1 Introduction The enormous number of rules generated to facilitate knowledge in data mining often makes the process of solving the decision problem difficult. It is therefore, important to have a simple model that is able to simplify the representation of real world problems and yet at the same time generate quality knowledge essential for good decision-making. In other words, an expert classification model should contain a manageable number of rules that do not use too many attributes. Such a model is able to fit a large number of objects with good predictive capabilities [1][2]. The main challenge in developing a good compact model is to determine whether the whole knowledge in the Information System (IS) or Decision System (DS) is always necessary to represent the system. This problem arises in many practical applications and is referred to as the knowledge",

The clear lack of convincing accuracy and flexibility in this area has attracted the attention of researchers over the past few years. Despite improvements achieved in effort estimating, there is no strong agreement as to which individual model is the best. Recent studies have found that an accurate estimation of development effort in software projects is unreachable in global space, meaning that proposing a high performance estimation model for use in different types of software projects is likely impossible. In this paper, a localized multi-estimator model, called LMES, is proposed in which software projects are classified based on underlying attributes. Different clusters of projects are then locally investigated so that the most accurate estimators are selected for each cluster. Unlike prior models …",36.0

Stakeholders are the key players in the requirements engineering process, and the selection of critical stakeholders for the VBS systems is highly desirable. Based on the stakeholder requirements, the innovative or value-based idea is realized. The quality of the VBS system is associated with the concrete set of valuable requirements, and the valuable requirements can only be obtained if all the relevant valuable stakeholders participate in the requirements elicitation phase. The existing value-based approaches focus on the design of the VBS systems. However, the focus on the valuable stakeholders and requirements is inadequate. The current stakeholder identification and quantification (SIQ) approaches are neither state-of-the-art nor systematic for the VBS systems. The existing approaches are time-consuming, complex and inconsistent which makes the initiation process difficult. Moreover, the main motivation of this research is that the existing SIQ approaches do not provide the low level implementation details for SIQ initiation and stakeholder metrics for quantification. Hence, keeping in view the existing SIQ problems, this research contributes in the form of a new SIQ framework called ‘StakeMeter’. The StakeMeter framework is verified and validated through case studies. The proposed framework provides low-level implementation guidelines, attributes, metrics, quantification criteria and application procedure as compared to the other methods.

Technique for early reliability prediction of software components using behaviour models,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163346,"Awad Ali, Dayang NA Jawawi, Mohd Adham Isa, Muhammad Imran Babar",2016/9/26,Plos one,,11.0,9,e0163346,Public Library of Science,"Behaviour models are the most commonly used input for predicting the reliability of a software system at the early design stage. A component behaviour model reveals the structure and behaviour of the component during the execution of system-level functionalities. There are various challenges related to component reliability prediction at the early design stage based on behaviour models. For example, most of the current reliability techniques do not provide fine-grained sequential behaviour models of individual components and fail to consider the loop entry and exit points in the reliability computation. Moreover, some of the current techniques do not tackle the problem of operational data unavailability and the lack of analysis results that can be valuable for software architects at the early design stage. This paper proposes a reliability prediction technique that, pragmatically, synthesizes system behaviour in the form of a state machine, given a set of scenarios and corresponding constraints as input. The state machine is utilized as a base for generating the component-relevant operational data. The state machine is also used as a source for identifying the nodes and edges of a component probabilistic dependency graph (CPDG). Based on the CPDG, a stack-based algorithm is used to compute the reliability. The proposed technique is evaluated by a comparison with existing techniques and the application of sensitivity analysis to a robotic wheelchair system as a case study. The results indicate that the proposed technique is more relevant at the early design stage compared to existing works, and can provide a more realistic and meaningful …",11.0

The goal of these is to synthesize behaviour models from system requirement specifications, in order to enable the early identification of weak design spots or code generation. To date, however, most of the scenario languages are poorly scaled with regards to system sizes. This is because scalability requires more expressive constructs that can help when writing a scenario specification in a concise and compact manner, thereby resulting in a reduced number of scenarios. Furthermore, due to a lack of expressiveness in scenario languages, synthesis algorithms may need to rely on global behaviour models to determine inter-scenario dependencies. The global model is an additional factor that limits the approaches’ scalability. The reason is that the construction of a global model becomes harder as the system specification increases. To tackle these issues, within this article is proposed an expressive scenario description language that provides a concise and compact approach to scenario description, and defines inter-scenario dependencies semantically. A new algorithm that can address the additional constructs of the language was defined, in order to synthesize componentcentric behaviour models. The applicability of this work has been demonstrated through both an illustrative example and a real-world case study. The evaluation indicates that the proposed scenario description language is more scalable than existing languages.",6.0

Variability in its own right is the central concept in SPL which is not being catered by conventional method of reuse. Consequently, it is important for variability to be identified and to be represented early at requirements phase. The importance of identifying requirements variability earlier at requirements level is also known as systematic reuse by researchers (Frakes and Isoda 1994; Muthig 2002). Variability at requirements levels also initiates the existence of the variability at architecture thus further highlight the inadequacy of considering variability solely at architectural level.

J. Advance Soft Compu. Appl,,5.0,3,,,"Precision Farming (PF) system is an alternative and innovative approach to improve the quality and production of crop yields. However, due to heterogeneity and user demands, PF system complexity has become higher. As such, software complexity has always been an issue in software development, especially for larger systems with innovative functionalities. One solution by which to reduce the problem of software complexity is by incorporating software reuse. Software Product Line (SPL) is a strategic reuse approach, which targets common artefacts for its product line while having a variability management mechanism to cater for variability in individual applications. This research proposes an integrated approach of SPL with architecture style selection and componentbased design for the precision farming domain. The focus of this paper is to highlight the process of architecture style selection in the proposed approach, which involves a multi-criteria design decision. The selection process uses a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP) in order to select the best architectural style, which can fulfil most of the sought-after criteria for precision farming product line application.",4.0

Several UML profiles are proposed for modeling of embedded real-time system and SOC separately. However, a holistic modeling solution, covering both the domains, is still missing. Therefore, a thorough investigation of existing UML profiles is necessary before proposing the holistic modeling solution. In this regard, this paper investigates two UML profiles: MARTE and SoaML profiles from the view of service-oriented development of DERTS. The paper highlights the portions of the two profiles that can be adopted and provides some suggestions that can be used for service-oriented modeling of DERTS.

Besides that, it can decrease the development time and improve the software quality. Therefore, existing component model such as MARMOT is introduced to master in multidisciplinary knowledge and PECOS is good support for multi-constraints extra-functionality requirement.

Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) system is a class of ERT systems, hence, inherits the challenge of applying software reuse in general ERT systems. Furthermore, software reuse in AMR systems is challenged by the diversities in terms of robot physical size and shape, environmental interaction and implementation platform. Thus, it is foresee that component-based reuse will be the suitable way to promote software reuse in AMR systems with consideration to three AMR general requirements to be self-contained, platform-independence and real-time predictable. In this thesis, a framework for component-based reuse of AMR software has been developed to enable a systematic reuse through component-based software engineering. The aim of the framework is to outline the strategies for software reuse in software development of AMR applications. The developed framework consists of four main elements: AMR component-based analysis patterns, a modified component model, a componentbased timing analysis approach, and a component-oriented programming framework. The results of implementing the framework in developing software for real AMR show that the strategies and processes proposed in the framework can fulfill the three AMR general requirements.

Many people find it difficult to communicate in emergency situations as a result of such communications. In this paper, a mobile cloud computing procedure is implemented in the suggested technique in order to prevent such circumstances, and to make the data transmission process more effective. An analytical framework that addresses five significant minimization and maximization objective functions is used to develop the projected model. Additionally, all mobile cloud computing nodes are designed with strong security, ensuring that all the resources are allocated appropriately. In order to isolate all the active functions, the analytical framework is coupled with a machine learning method known as Decision Tree. The suggested approach benefits society because all cloud nodes can extend their assistance in times of need at an affordable operating and maintenance cost. The efficacy of the proposed approach is tested in five scenarios, and the results of each scenario show that it is significantly more effective than current case studies on an average of 86%.",2.0

The medium-access protocol design solves the energy usage of sensor nodes while transmitting and receiving data, thereby improving the sensor network’s lifetime. The suggested work employs a hybrid algorithm to improve the energy efficiency of sensor networks with nodes that are regularly placed. Every node in this protocol has three operating modes, which are sleep mode, receive mode, and send mode. Every node enters a periodic sleep state in order to conserve energy, and after waking up, it waits for communication. During the sleep mode, the nodes turn off their radios in order to reduce the amount of energy they consume while not in use. As an added feature, this article offers a channel access mechanism in which the sensors can send data based on the Logical Link Decision (LLD) algorithm and receive data based on the adaptive reception method. It is meant to select acceptable intermediary nodes in order to identify the path from the source to the destination and to minimize data transmission delays among the nodes in the network scenario. Aside from that, both simulation and analytical findings are used to examine the activity of the suggested MAC, and the created models are evaluated depending on their performance. With regard to energy consumption, latency, throughput, and power efficiency, the result demonstrates that the suggested MAC protocol outperforms the corresponding set of rules.

This makes the use of PNP worth to be widen but delivering needs of PNP involves high efforts. Thus, Service Oriented Product Line (SOPL) is introduced as systematic approach in identifying reusable core assets to reduce time and effort in developing new PNP. Consequently, due to reusable nature of core assets, evaluating its reusability is crucial to determine the development performance. Therefore, this paper measures reusability of core assets to ensure that core assets development approach can lead to highly reusable core assets. Methods: Reusability Matrix for Functional Commonality (FC) and Modularity (MD) is considered to compose core assets without much complication. Reusable core assets derived from two different development approaches is used as input where matrix of reusability evaluation is applied. The approaches includes an approach from previous existing study and enhanced approach with implementation of Business Process Feature Model (BPFM) and Trade-off Analysis. Evaluation results is compared using reusability matrix to identify which approach contributes to higher core assets reusability. Results: From overall results, enhanced approach shows an improved reusability by achieving 92% of FC results compared to existing approach, while results of MD remains the same.

To complement each approach with the benefits of the other, various methods of integration of the two approaches were proposed in the past. Aspect-oriented code generation, which targets obtaining aspect-oriented code directly from aspect models, offers some unique advantages over the other integration approaches. However, the existing aspect-oriented code generation approaches do not comprehensively address all aspects of a model-driven code generation system, such as a textual representation of graphical models, conceptual mapping, and incorporation of behavioral diagrams. These problems limit the worth of generated code, especially in practical use. Here, we propose AJFCode, an approach for aspect-oriented modeldriven code generation, which comprehensively addresses the various aspects including the graphical models and their text-based representation, mapping between visual model elements and code, and the behavioral code generation.

Spotting the light on technical aspects showed that several factors contribute to this failure. Starting from pre-implementation phase with Business Process Reengineering (BPR) execution failure, or during the implementation phase due to miscommunication or incapable project members. The research amount in this field, particularly in critical failure factors is not sufficient to learn from and avoid future implementations, hence this topic provides insights about this specific issue.

Missing Data (MD) is one of major challenges in software engineering datasets. Several missing data imputation techniques have been investigated by researchers in ABE model. Identification of the most similar donor values from the completed software projects dataset for imputation is a challenging issue in existing missing data techniques adopted for ABE model. In this study, Fuzzy C-Mean Imputation (FCMI), Mean Imputation (MI) and K-Nearest Neighbor Imputation (KNNI) are investigated to impute missing values in Desharnais dataset under different missing data percentages (Desh-Miss1, Desh-Miss2) for ABE model. FCMI-ABE technique is proposed in this study. Evaluation comparison among MI, KNNI, and (ABE-FCMI) is conducted for ABE model to identify the suitable MD imputation method. The results suggest that the use of (ABE-FCMI), rather than MI and KNNI, imputes more reliable values to incomplete software projects in the missing datasets.

However, stakeholder decision making which result from the imprecise, uncertain, and subjective nature of architecture selection based on quality attributes (QA) further hinders the development of the product line architecture. Therefore, this study aims to propose a quality-driven approach using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques for Software Product Line Architecture (SPLA) to have an objective selection based on the QA of stakeholders in the domain of PNP. There are two steps proposed to this approach. First, a clear representation of quality is proposed by extending feature model (FM) with QA feature to determine the QA in the early phase of architecture selection. Second, MCDA techniques were applied for architecture selection based on objective preference for certain QA in the domain of PNP. The result of the proposed approach is the implementation of the PNP system with SPLA that had been selected using MCDA techniques. Evaluation for the approach is done by checking the approach’s applicability in a case study and stakeholder validation.

An Intelligent Framework for Test Case Prioritization Using Evolutionary Algorithm,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201634347630986.page,"Mojtaba Raeisi Nejad Dobuneh, Dayang NA Jawawi",2016,Journal of Internet Computing and Services,,17.0,5,89-95,Korean Society for Internet Information,"In a software testing domain, test case prioritization techniques improve the performance of regression testing, and arrange test cases in such a way that maximum available faults be detected in a shorter time. User-sessions and cookies are unique features of web applications that are useful in regression testing because they have precious information about the application state before and after making changes to software code. This approach is in fact a user-session based technique. The user session will collect from the database on the server side, and test cases are released by the small change configuration of a user session data. The main challenges are the effectiveness of Average Percentage Fault Detection rate (APFD) and time constraint in the existing techniques, so in this paper developed an intelligent framework which has three new techniques use to manage and put test cases in group by applying useful criteria for test case prioritization in web application regression testing. In dynamic weighting approach the hybrid criteria which set the initial weight to each criterion determines optimal weight of combination criteria by evolutionary algorithms. The weight of each criterion is based on the effectiveness of finding faults in the application. In this research the priority is given to test cases that are performed based on most common http requests in pages, the length of http request chains, and the dependency of http requests. To verify the new technique some fault has been seeded in subject application, then applying the prioritization criteria on test cases for comparing the effectiveness of APFD rate with existing techniques.",

The proposed algorithm is inspired by the behavior of electromagnets with different polarities and takes advantage of a nature-inspired ratio, known as the golden ratio. In EFO, a possible solution is an electromagnetic particle made of electromagnets, and the number of electromagnets is determined by the number of variables of the optimization problem. EFO is a populationbased algorithm in which the population is divided into three fields (positive, negative, and neutral); attraction–repulsion forces among electromagnets of these three fields lead particles toward global minima. The golden ratio determines the ratio between attraction and repulsion forces to help particles converge quickly and effectively. The experimental results on 30 high dimensional CEC 2014 benchmarks reflect the superiority of EFO in terms of accuracy and convergence speed over other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.",

This study aims to assess existing UML-based aspect-oriented modeling techniques from the perspective of their suitability with regards to integration into model-driven engineering process through aspect-oriented code generation. We defined an evaluation framework and employed it to evaluate 14 well-published, UML-based aspect-oriented modeling approaches. Further, based on the comparison results, we selected 2 modeling approaches, Reusable Aspect Models and Theme/UML, and proceeded to evaluate them in a detailed way from specific perspectives of design and its mapping to the implementation code. Results of the comparison of 14 approaches show that majority of aspect modeling approaches lack from different perspectives, which results in reducing their use in practice within the context of model-driven engineering. The in-depth comparison of Reusable Aspect Models and Theme/UML reveals some points equally shared by both approaches, and identifies some areas where the former has advantage over the latter.",

A Weakly Hard Real-Time Scheduling Analysis Framework Using Genetic Algorithm,http://www.i-csrs.org/Volumes/ijasca/Paper26-Habibah-Ismail.pdf,"Habibah Ismail, Dayang NA Jawawi",2013/12/1,Int. J. Advance Soft Compu. Appl,,5.0,3,,,"In relation to real-time systems, hard real-time and soft real-time systems are based on “miss restriction” and “miss tolerance”, respectively. However, a weakly hard real-time system integrates both these requirements. The problem with these systems is the limitation of the scheduling analysis method which only uses the traditional scheduling approach. Besides that, the current framework has problems with the complexity and predictability of the systems. This paper proposes a scheduling analysis framework based on, namely: the suitability of scheduling algorithms, the weakly hard real-time modelling and genetic algorithm approach for predicting the weakly hard real-time tasks. Initially, the best fitting specification of a weakly hard real-time system was integrated into the proposed framework and tested in the Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded systems (MARTE) profile. Sequence diagram complexity factor metrics were used to measure the behavioural complexity of the UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time (SPT) and MARTE profiles. Further, the genetic algorithm approach was applied on the framework to measure the predictability of the soft real-time tasks. The results of the framework showed that the number of deadlines missed among the tasks was optimized by applying the framework on a case study. In conclusion, the proposed scheduling analysis framework provides a less complex design through the UML design modelling, as well as increasing the predictability of the systems.",

In particular, Analogy Based Estimation (ABE), as a widely accepted estimation method, suffers a great deal from the problem of inconsistent and non-normal datasets because it is a comparison-based method and the quality of comparisons strongly depends on the consistency of projects. In order to overcome this problem, prior studies have suggested the use of weighting methods, outlier elimination techniques and various types of soft computing methods. However the proposed methods have reduced the complexity and uncertainty of projects, the results are not still convincing and the methods are limited to a special domain of software projects, which causes the generalization of methods to be impossible. Localization of comparison and weighting processes through clustering of projects is the main idea behind this paper. A hybrid model is proposed in which the software projects are divided into several clusters based on key attributes (development type, organization type and development platform). A combination of ABE and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to design a weighting system in which the project attributes of different clusters are given different weights. Instead of comparing a new project with all the historical projects, it is only compared with the projects located in the related clusters based on the common attributes. The proposed method",

Hospitals or healthcare centers will provide rehabilitation treatments to these patients for recovery of their physical, sensory or mental ability. The current workflow of Rehabilitation Department in Hospital Sultanah Aminah (HSA) is in manual ways such as recording the information of patients, appointments, and rehabilitation assessment of paralyzed patients in paper documents. It is quite hard to ensure the correctness of information because human errors may occur during the recording process. Therefore, a mobile based Patient Navigation System for rehabilitation of paralyzed patients was proposed. In this system, the system admin can register users and manage users. This system allows the community (Pharmacist, Healthcare Center etc.) and nurse to register new patients. Besides, this system allows the nurse to set the appointment of the patient in specific date and time, manage appointment requests made by patients and make vital check-up of patient. Furthermore, the doctor can make general assessment and view notification on the new appointment set, appointment information, and assessment report. For the patients, they can manage profile, make appointment request, and view notification on the new appointment set, appointment information, and appointment request status. While for the physiotherapist and occupational therapist, they can make stroke assessment and progress assessment respectively. Agile-Kanban methodology was chosen to develop this system.

One of the most common risk of having this problem is due to age. The older a person gets, the higher the risk of getting this illness. As human gets older too, they tend to be more forgetful. With these two statements, if senior citizens were to have a high blood pressure, they may forget to take their medicine in addition to not knowing how to search beneficial information regarding blood pressure on the internet as they are not as tech-savvy. Therefore, monitoring high blood pressure is needed as without the right care, problems from high blood pressure may occur. A mobile application would especially be helpful as in these days, everyone has a smartphone. Therefore, an application called “HyperRemedy” is proposed. The aim of this project is to develop the “HyperRemedy” mobile application for senior citizens to track and monitor their blood pressure reading, receiving monthly graph that is easy to read, receiving extra information on their food intake based on the readings and also to set a reminder for their medicine intake in an aim to aid the senior citizens with high blood pressure illness. This application would be beneficial for the senior citizens who are not tech-savvy to receive extra information such as the food intake. Not only that, the project also would be able to help senior citizens to not forget on their medicine intake and aid them to record their daily blood pressure readings.

The femtocells provide a solution to improve indoor coverage of cellular mobile devices in the areas where the coverage is weak and intermittent while using macrocells. The use of data hungry devices such as, tablets, smartphones and other wireless devices are increasing rapidly with time and is a driving force for innovative ways in wireless communication to provide fast access to the internet, more capacity and higher quality of service. Femtocells can provide a useful way for mobile operators to offer a better user experience and deliver indoors broadband services consistently and reliably for a comparable context of application, distances, and obstacles. The proposed work will analyze the efficiency of femtocells in terms of its convergence along with WiMAX wireless technologies. The study will show how the coverage is improved by femtocells and how the total network capacity gains can be up to many times as compared to the current macro layer networks. This analysis will be based on more detailed performance parameters such as throughput, packet loss, packet end to end delay, download and upload response times for multimedia traffic. The femto access points (FAPs) will enhance data rates via improving link quality, shorter communication distance and less penetration loss resulting into increased capacity of the entire system.",

There are a considerable number of models proposed in this research area. Therefore, researchers are of interest to compare the models to identify the best one for software development effort estimation. This research showed that most of the studies used mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) and percentage of prediction (PRED) for the comparison of their estimation models. Still, it was also found in this study that there are quite a number of criticisms done on accuracy statistics like MMRE and PRED by renowned authors. It was found that MMRE is an unbalanced, biased, and inappropriate performance measure for identifying the best among competing estimation models. The accuracy statistics, eg, MMRE and PRED, are still adopted in the evaluation criteria by the domain researchers, stating the reason for “widely used,” which is not a valid reason. This research study identified that, since there is no practical solution provided so far, which could replace MMRE and PRED, the researchers are adopting these measures. The approach of partitioning the large dataset into subsamples was tried in this paper using estimation by analogy (EBA) model. One small and one large dataset were considered for it, such as Desharnais and ISBSG release 11. The ISBSG dataset is a large dataset concerning Desharnais. The ISBSG dataset was partitioned into subsamples. The results suggested that when the large datasets are partitioned, the MMRE produces the same or nearly the same results, which it produces for the small …",

Variability Integration at Requirements and Architecture Level in Software Product Line Engineering,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3098683462504481724&hl=en&oi=scholarr,"Shahliza Abd Halim, Dayang Norhayati Abang Jawawi, Safaai Deris",,,,,,,,"Software reuse promised higher productivity and quality and reducing product delivery time. Nevertheless, this advantage could not be reaped without systematic software reuse. One of the significant approaches for systematic software reuse is Software Product Line (SPL). SPL considers related products in a domain in terms of its commonality (known as core asset), its differences (known as variability) and its derivation in order to build specific product in the product line. With first class consideration of variability, it enables effective reuse of artefacts thus assisting in an easier derivation of individual members in SPL compared to developing similar products as single system development. However the identification of variability at the architectural level requires the understanding of variability at the requirements level. Therefore, the integration and relations between variability in requirement and architecture level of the core asset must be explicitly defined for stakeholders to understand how designers realized product line variability and also for product derivation. This paper reports ongoing research in designing and implementing variability representation between different abstraction levels in SPL.",

This software engineering methodology was tested on a wall climbing robot system under hardware-in-the-loop simulation and was found to be effective and the software produced, conformed to the requirements. However, a few questions are still need to be answered and measured in order to fully test the effectiveness of the hybrid methodology on actual embedded system. The main objective of this research is to evaluate the hybrid software engineering methodology for developing control firmware on actual system. An intelligence mobile robot was developed to serve as embedded real-time system platform. Two main outputs of this research is evaluation results on strengths and weaknesses of the hybrid software engineering methodology and identification of the phases in the methodology, which require automation and can be automated.",

Generative reuse via application generator is cost effective to build when many similar software systems are written or when evolution of software requires the software to be written and rewritten many times during its lifetime. Software Product Line (SPL) is a suitable field to implement application generator where it can help to generate similar systems and also customize variations needed to the systems functionalities. SPL is a type of reuse where common artifacts can be shared by similar software or members in the product line. Besides sharing common features, each member in the product line has significant variations referred as variability. Variability implementation requires focus on two important issues: delaying design decision and also ease of changes in software. This study is based on the initial proposal of two methods: stepwise refinements and separation of concerns, for the use in generator implementation. Generators with the implementation of these methods have been reportedly used in various SPL implementations. Based on this motivation we study the underlying concepts of these methods and the origin of its idea. We also study the issues and its current implementation in generator.

Transforms depend on different methods of contour extraction like Sobel, Canny and SSPCE (single step parallel contour extraction) methods. To remove the noise from the medical image the pre-processing stage (filtering by median & enhancement by linear contrast stretch) is performed. The extracted contour is compressed using well-known method (Ramer). Experimental results and analysis show that proposed algorithm is trustworthy in establishing the ownership. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean square error (MSE), and compression ratio (CR) values obtained from MSB, MGL, DCT & DWT methods are compared. Experimental results show that the contours of the original medical image can be extracted easily with few contour points at high compression exceeded to 87% in some cases. The simplicity of the method with accepted level of the reconstruction is the main advantage of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that this method improves the contrast of medical images and can help with better diagnosis after contour extraction. This proposed method is very useful for real time application.",

This synthesis analysis allows us to detect error at an early stage of development and unfeasible real time architectures. Furthermore, it prevents from design mistakes and accelerates development schedules. This integration also allows the developer to verify the real time performance of the design at early phase before proceeding to coding phase. As a result, aim of this paper is to show the integration approach which allows the developer to verify the real time performance of the design at early phase before coding phase.

The mapping is basically at requirements to architecture levels as it can reap benefits as suggested by several researchers. However it is insufficient in mapping between different abstraction levels by only concentrating on one type of model to assist in the mapping process. In this paper we concentrate on multiple models at requirements level in order to map essential information at the architectural level. These multiple model is implemented in Software Product Line (SPL) where the models itself needs to be extended to explicitly show the commonality and variability in the models. Therefore, profile extension with the use of appropriate stereotypes has been used as an extension for the models. Given the different notations and stereotypes of each model, the mapping is based at the metamodel level which represented using one uniform notation. The multiple model approach is implemented to Autonomous Mobile Robot Product Line (AMRPL) case study to show the applicability of the multiple model approach. The applicability of the mapping established between the multiple models facilitate the possibility of representing functional and non functional requirements and its mapping to architectural level. However, further refinements are needed to the mapping to promote improvement of its usage in modeling SPL based applications.",

A late detection of the performance failure especially after system deployment could reflect the reliability of the system and thus, could lead to the undesired disaster such as death. Therefore, as to overcome this problem, current methods for software quality analysis has introduced a multi-state analysis as early during design level. These methods however fail to address the unified model as to accommodate between performance and reliability attribute. By treating a unified model as a predictive model, a tradeoff analysis for performance and reliability can be done at design time, accommodate with failure behavior model and systematic modeling and analysis process. Therefore, to realize this purpose, a new approach is proposed for model based performance and reliability analysis during design time.

The intermediate model then is used for quality analysis process, which includes three analysis views, namely, individual attribute analysis, integration analysis and risk analysis.

Vehicles in VANETs share real-time information about their movement state, traffic situation, and road conditions. However, VANETs are susceptible to the cyberattacks that create life threatening situations and/or cause road congestion. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that rely on the cooperation between vehicles to detect intruders, were the most suggested security solutions for VANET.

Consequently, the rate of crypto-ransomware novel attacks is continuously increasing. As such, it is imperative for detection solutions to be able to discover these novel attacks, also called zero-day attacks.

The majority of dynamic analysis relies on the system calls, as these provide an interface for programs to request service from the operating system. However, the redundancy and the irrelevant system calls that the ransomware authors inject in the actual execution flow of suspicious binaries generate a high noisy behavioural sequence that adversely impacts in the detection performance of anti-ransomware tools.

We consider the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) as the most dangerous type of flooding attack that could target those resources. The DDoS attack consumes network available resources such as bandwidth, processing power, and memory, thereby limiting or withholding accessibility to users. The Flash Crowd (FC) is quite similar to the DDoS attack whereby many legitimate users concurrently access a particular service, the number of which results in the denial of service. Researchers have proposed many different models to eliminate the risk of DDoS attacks, but only few efforts have been made to differentiate it from FC flooding as FC flooding also causes the denial of service and usually misleads the detection of the DDoS attacks. In this paper, an adaptive agent-based model, known as an Adaptive Protection of Flooding Attacks (APFA) model, is proposed to protect the Network Application Layer (NAL) against DDoS flooding attacks and FC flooding traffics. The APFA model, with the aid of an adaptive analyst agent, distinguishes between DDoS and FC abnormal traffics. It then separates DDoS botnet from Demons and Zombies to apply suitable attack handling methodology. There are three parameters on which the agent relies, normal traffic intensity, traffic attack behavior, and IP address history log, to decide on the operation of two traffic filters.

However, spreading inaccurate, unreliable, and false data by intruders create traffic illusions that may cause loss of lives and assets. Although several solutions for misbehavior detection have been proposed to address these issues, those solutions lack adequate representation and the adaptability to vehicular context. The use of predefined static thresholds and lack of comprehensive context representation have rendered the existing solutions limited to specific scenarios and attack types, which impedes their generalizability. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing an ensemble-based hybrid context-aware misbehavior detection system (EHCA-MDS) model. EHCA-MDS has been developed in four phases, as follows. The static thresholds have been replaced by dynamic ones created on the fly by analyzing the spatial and temporal properties of the mobility information collected from neighboring vehicles.

By encrypting the operational data, the ransomware attacks can disrupt the normal operations, which represents a serious problem for industrial systems. Ransomware employs several avoidance techniques, such as packing, obfuscation, noise insertion, irrelevant and redundant system call injection, to deceive the security measures and make both static and dynamic analysis more difficult. In this paper, a Weighted minimum Redundancy maximum Relevance (WmRmR) technique was proposed for better feature significance estimation in the data captured during the early stages of ransomware attacks. The technique combines an enhanced mRMR (EmRmR) with the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) so that it can filter out the runtime noisy behavior based on the weights calculated by the TF-IDF. The proposed technique has the capability to assess whether a feature in the relevant set is important or not.

Due to the limited number of orthogonal channels, interference between channels adversely affects the fair distribution of bandwidth among mesh clients, causing node starvation in terms of insufficient bandwidth distribution, which impedes the adoption of WMN as an efficient access technology. Therefore, a fair channel assignment is crucial for the mesh clients to utilize the available resources. However, the node starvation problem due to unfair channel distribution has been vastly overlooked during channel assignment by the extant research.

VANETs’ applications rely on co-operativeness among vehicles by periodically sharing their context information, such as position speed and acceleration, among others, at a high rate due to high vehicles mobility. However, rogue nodes, which exploit the co-operativeness feature and share false messages, can disrupt the fundamental operations of any potential application and cause the loss of people’s lives and properties. Unfortunately, most of the current solutions cannot effectively detect rogue nodes due to the continuous context change and the inconsideration of dynamic data uncertainty during the identification. Although there are few context-aware solutions proposed for VANET, most of these solutions are data-centric. A vehicle is considered malicious if it shares false or inaccurate messages.

However, vehicular networks are decentralized, characterized by high mobility and dynamicity, and vehicles move in a hostile environment; such characteristics make VANET applications suffer many security and communication issues. Recently, blockchain has been suggested to solve several VANET issues including the dissemination of trustworthy life-threatening information. However, existing dissemination schemes are inefficient for safety messages and are vulnerable to malicious nodes and rely on the majority of honest assumptions. In the VANET context, adversaries may collude to broadcast false information causing serious safety threats. This study proposes an intelligent proof-of-trustworthiness-based secure safety message dissemination scheme (PoTMDS) to efficiently share only trustworthy messages. The consistency and plausibility of the message were evaluated based on a predictive model developed using a convolutional neural network and signal properties such as the received signal strength and angle of arrival. A blockchain-based data dissemination scheme was developed to share critical messages. Each vehicle calculates the proof of trustworthiness of the disseminated messages by comparing the received message with the output of the prediction model. The results showed that the proposed scheme reduced the consensus delay by 58% and improved the detection accuracy by 7.8%. Therefore, the proposed …",

A New Collaborative Multi‐Agent Monte Carlo Simulation Model for Spatial Correlation of Air Pollution Global Risk Assessment,https://www.mdpi.com/1434504,"Mohammed Ahmed Jubair Mustafa Hamid Hassan, Aida Mustapha, Mohd Zainuri Saringat, Bander Ali Saleh Al‐rimy, A.E.M. Eljialy",2022/1,Sustainability,,14.0,2022,,MDPI,"Air pollution risk assessment is complex due to dynamic data change and pollution source distribution. Air quality index concentration level prediction is an effective method of protecting public health by providing the means for an early warning against harmful air pollution. However, air quality index-based prediction is challenging as it depends on several complicated factors resulting from dynamic nonlinear air quality time-series data, such as dynamic weather patterns and the verity and distribution of air pollution sources. Subsequently, some minimal models have incorporated a time series-based predicting air quality index at a global level (for a particular city or various cities). These models require interaction between the multiple air pollution sensing sources and additional parameters like wind direction and wind speed. The existing methods in predicting air quality index cannot handle short-term dependencies. These methods also mostly neglect the spatial correlations between the different parameters. Moreover, the assumption of selecting the most recent part of the air quality time series is not valid considering that pollution is cyclic behavior according to various events and conditions due to the high possibility of falling into the trap of local minimum and poor generalization. Therefore, this paper proposes a new air pollution global risk assessment (APGRA) prediction model for an air quality index of spatial correlations to address these issues. The APGRA model incorporates an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), a Monte Carlo simulation, a collaborative multi-agent system, and a prediction algorithm for reducing air …",

Due to the limited number of orthogonal channels, interference between channels adversely affects the fair distribution of bandwidth among mesh clients, causing node starvation in terms of insufficient bandwidth distribution, which impedes the adoption of WMN as an efficient access technology. erefore, a fair channel assignment is crucial for the mesh clients to utilize the available resources. However, the node starvation problem due to unfair channel distribution has been vastly overlooked during channel assignment by the extant research. Instead, existing channel assignment algorithms equally distribute the interference reduction on the links to achieve fairness which neither guarantees a fair distribution of the network bandwidth nor eliminates node starvation. In addition, the metaheuristic-based solutions such as genetic algorithm, which is commonly used for WMN, use randomness in creating initial population and selecting the new generation usually leading the search to local minima.

Even after neutralizing such attacks, the targeted files remain encrypted. This irreversible effect on the target is what distinguishes cryptoransomware attacks from traditional malware. Thus, it is imperative to detect such attacks during pre-encryption phase. However, existing crypto-ransomware early detection solutions are not effective due to inaccurate definition of the pre-encryption phase boundaries, insufficient data at that phase and the misuse-based approach that the solutions employ, which is not suitable to detect new (zero-day) attacks. Consequently, those solutions suffer from low detection accuracy and high false alarms. Therefore, this research addressed these issues and developed an Ensemble-Based Anomaly-Behavioural Pre-encryption Detection Model (EABDM) to overcome data insufficiency and improve detection accuracy of known and novel cryptoransomware attacks. In this research, three phases were used in the development of EABDM.

However, recent advances in digital media and platforms have seen an increased need for the application of digital forensic investigation techniques to other subdomains including small and mobile devices, databases, networks, cloudbased platforms, and the Internet of Things (IoT). To assist forensic investigators, conduct investigations within these subdomains, academic researchers have attempted to develop a number of investigative processes. However, many of these processes are domain-specific or describe domain-specific investigative tools. Hence, we hypothesize that the literature is littered with potentially overlapping and contradicting investigative process for conducting investigations within these subdomains. To investigate this hypothesis, a digital forensic model-orientated Systematic Literature Review (SLR) within the above digital forensic subdomains was undertaken. The purpose of the SLR was to identify the different and heterogeneous practices that have emerged within the specific subdomains. A key finding from the SLR is that there is a potential information overload and a high-degree of ambiguity among investigative processes in the above subdomains.

To accurately find out the suitable protocol, used traffic model should be as real as possible. Many studies used Constant Bit Rate (CBR) as a traffic model which generates a constant traffic patterns.

One promising way to implement this service is through the use of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. This tracking method provides the pinpointing of standalone tracking information but is handicapped by missing stance phase during pedestrian walking activities.

When this happens, users will encounter difficulty in navigating directly on-site, especially within an indoor environment. Occasionally, there is a need to integrate with other sensors in order to establish the location with greater intelligence, reliability, and ubiquity. The use of positioning integration may be useful since it involves as many beacons as necessary to determine positioning. However, the implementation of the integration in the mobile devices platform may lead high computation which in turn could increase power consumption.

To improve the performance, those aspects must be considered further as they are inter-related with each other. A novel modification of SBLPRM that decreases the size of excessive configurations in the roadmap, by incrementally bu ildi ng a one-tree structure originating from the start configuration, is presented.

At present, the constraints faced by WSN that are distributed unevenly are the weak level of accuracy of the data obtained, which can be caused by the weakness of the WSN itself, namely resource limitations in the form of bandwidth, power, delay, latency, and computing. Therefore, an intelligent algorithm that functions to process data based on the unevenly distributed WSN was needed to get better accuracy in building fire determination information. This study used 2 types of algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN) for the grouping of positions from the scattered WSN, and the Decision Tree algorithm to determine the outcome of a building fire decision based on each of the grouping results.

An Improved Resampling Scheme for Particle Filtering in Inertial Navigation System,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-14802-7_48,"Wan Mohd Yaakob Wan Bejuri, Mohd Murtadha Mohamad, Raja Zahilah Raja Mohd Radzi, Sheikh Hussain Shaikh Salleh",2019,,,,,555-563,Springer International Publishing,"  The particle filter provides numerical approximation to the nonlinear filtering problem in inertial navigation system. In the heterogeneous environment, reliable state estimation is the critical issue. The state estimation will increase the positioning error in the overall system. To address such problem, the sequential implementation resampling (SIR) considers cause and environment for every specific resampling task decision in particle filtering. However, by only considering the cause and environment in a specific situation, SIR cannot generate reliable state estimation during their process. This paper proposes an improved resampling scheme to particle filtering for different sample impoverishment environment.

Thus, one needs a new sequential resampling algorithm that is flexible enough to allow it to be used with various computing devices. Therefore, this paper formulated a new single distribution resampling called the adaptive memory size-based single distribution resampling (AMSSDR). This resampling method integrates traditional variation resampling and traditional resampling in one architecture. The algorithm changes the resampling algorithm using the memory in a computing device. This helps the developer formulate a particle filter without over considering the computing devices’ memory utilisation during the development of different particle filters. At the start of the operational process, it uses the AMSSDR selector to choose an appropriate resampling algorithm (for example, rounding copy resampling or systematic resampling), based on the current computing devices’ physical memory. If one chooses systematic resampling, the resampling will sample every particle for every cycle. On the other hand, if it chooses the rounding copy resampling, the resampling will sample more than one of each cycle’s particle. This illustrates that the method (AMSSDR) being proposed is capable of switching resampling algorithms based on various physical memory requirements.

Although many studies evaluated cryptocurrency from the Shariah perspective, they focused only on the Cryptocurrency concept and did not consider the underlying blockchain technology. However, designing a Shariah compliant application on top of a non Shariah compliant platform does not fulfil the requirements of Shariah. Therefore, it is necessary to use a Shariah compliant blockchain platform in order to produce Shariah compliant blockchain applications. To support the production of Shariah compliant blockchain applications, this study provides a comparative analysis of the most used consensus algorithms in blockchain platforms. In particular, the considered consensus algorithms are evaluated from a Shariah perspective. In conclusion, based on the conducted evaluation some of the widely used blockchain platforms (e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum) are found to be not compliant with the Shariah rules due to using a consensus algorithm that is not Shariah compliant.",

It refers to learning delivered fully or partly electronically rather than wholly through the traditional medium of a face-to-face classroom. The term is often used to indicate terms such as online learning and distance learning which are learning modes that may employ e-learning for their delivery (Moore, Dickson-Deane, & Galyen, 2011). Nichols (2008) describes e-learning as ‘computer-based sharing and dissemination of knowledge and learning activities’ and went on to describe its application in course modelling towards promoting, sharing and reuse of course contents and teaching materials and support for personalized learning. There are many positive outcomes from collaborating through e-Learning; a tutor or instructor is able to deliver knowledge much quicker without additional labour costs to geographically dispersed learners at any time while learners can experience a sense of learning community and a sense of purpose for participation through their interaction with others.Over the years, there has been progress from e-Learning 1.0 with a focus on content delivery to e-Learning 2.0 which is more learner-focused (Lim, So, & Tan, 2010). e-Learning 2.0 offers synchronously and asynchronously communications. Synchronous e-Learning is advantageous in fostering the feeling of being a part of a community of learners through real-time interaction with instructor and peers. Synchronous e-Learning is also able to assist in preventing the feelings of isolation and frustration that can be experienced by distance learners (Hrastinski, 2008).

High pressure and harsh environment of underwater have turned it into an unknown and mysterious area for human. Among the various methods used for data collection from deep water, underwater wireless acoustic sensor network (UWASN) has attracted considerable attention recently. Since the operating environment and communication medium of these networks differ from terrestrial wireless sensor networks (WSNs), new routing protocols have been developed for UWASNs which makes the existing routing protocol classification of terrestrial WSNs inapplicable. In order to deal with this challenge, a novel classification of routing protocols for UWASNs is proposed in this paper and each category is described by illustrative examples. The characteristics of each category are compared to the ones of other categories and the advantages and drawbacks are pinpointed. Finally, the illustrative examples are compared in terms of routing characteristics.",

Meanwhile, the realization of these applications is confronted with some underwater limitations namely, acoustic channel constraint, limited bandwidth, and water pressure. Several routing algorithms have been developed to achieve efficient data gathering. However, these algorithms are challenged with communication void problem. The communication void problem leads to packet drop/error and high energy consumption in the course of data packet forwarding. Therefore, in this paper, an improved communication void avoidance mechanism for UWSN has been proposed for handling void hole during data packet forwarding considering dislodgment of sensor nodes. The performance of the proposed mechanism has been evaluated against the adapted adjustment mechanism to confirm its benefit based on different data packet forwarding and energy efficiency metrics.",

Current code clone research focuses on the detection and analysis of code clones in order to help software developers identify code clones in source codes and reuse the source codes in order to decrease the maintenance cost. Many approaches such as textual based comparison approach, token based comparison and tree based comparison approach have been used to detect code clones. As software grows and becomes a legacy system, the complexity of these approaches in detecting code clones increases. Thus, this scenario makes it more difficult to detect code clones. Generic pipeline model is the most recent code clone detection that comprises five processes which are parsing process, pre-processing process, pooling process, comparing processes and filtering process to detect code clone. This research highlights the enhancement of the generic pipeline model using divide and conquer approach that involves concatenation process. The aim of this approach is to produce a better input for the generic pipeline model by processing smaller part of source code files before focusing on the large chunk of source codes in a single pipeline.

A Document-Like Software Visualization Method for Effective Cognition of C-Based Software Systems,http://eprints.utm.my/id/eprint/3995/1/ShahidaSulaimanPFSKSM2004.pdf,Shahida Sulaiman,2004/7,,,,,,,"It is clear that maintenance is a crucial and very costly process in a software life cycle. Nowadays there are a lot of software systems particularly legacy systems that are always maintained from time to time as new requirements arise. One important source to understand a software system before it is being maintained is through the documentation, particularly system documentation. Unfortunately, not all software systems developed or maintained are accompanied with their reliable and updated documents. In this case, source codes will be the only reliable source for programmers. A number of studies have been carried out in order to assist cognition based on source codes. One way is through tool automation via reverse engineering technique in which source codes will be parsed and the information extracted will be visualized using certain visualization methods. Most software visualization methods use graph as the main element to represent extracted software artifacts. Nevertheless, current methods tend to produce more complicated graphs and do not grant an explicit, document-like re-documentation environment. Hence, this thesis proposes a document-like software visualization method called DocLike Modularized Graph (DMG). The method is realized in a prototype tool named DocLike Viewer that targets on C-based software systems. The main contribution of the DMG method is to provide an explicit structural re-document mechanism in the software visualization tool.

Viewing Software Artifacts for Different Software Maintenance Categories Using Graph Representations,http://ojie.um.edu.my/index.php/MJCS/article/view/6217,Shahida Sulaiman,2004/12/1,Malaysian Journal of Computer Science,,17.0,2,55-67,,"Information needed during an iterative process of a software maintenance process is much different from that of a software development process. Without up-dated documents, software maintainers need to gain information required to solve different maintenance categories through source codes hence consuming more time and effort. With the emergence of reverse engineering tools, the process of understanding source codes to solve maintenance tasks in different maintenance categories can be improved. Such tools employ diverse software visualisation methods that generate graph representations of parsed software artifacts. This paper discusses on how the graph representations provided by the proposed DocLike Modularised Graph (DMG) method employed in DocLike Viewer prototype tool can serve different levels of information needed by software maintainers in the case of corrective, adaptive and perfective maintenance category. It is observed that not only do software maintainers require diverse level of information; the necessity of the information is also not exactly of the same degree.",2.0

Teaching Software Engineering Virtually during COVID-19 Pandemic Era: Lessons Learned.,https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3062/Paper03_SEED.pdf,Shahida Sulaiman,2021,,,,,14-21,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world since December 2019 and it had been serious in Malaysia in middle of March 2020. In Malaysia, the Movement Control Order (MCO) has forced many sectors to cease operation except those in essentials sectors. The pandemic has transformed many sectors including tertiary education dramatically mainly in its digital applications. Although face-to-face teaching and learning has been the bread and butter for most of tertiary higher learning institutions, the pandemic has forced 360-degree change in the way teaching and learning materials to be delivered. This includes the transformation in assessment methods that forced lecturers to find the best alternative in assessing their students. This paper reports the lessons learned in teaching Software Engineering course that has been transformed to 100 percent online teaching and learning (OLTnL) during COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia between March to June 2021. The subjects were second year students of two sections of 44 and 37 respectively who enrolled Software Engineering course as one of the core courses at the selected faculty offering a Bachelor of Computer Science program. The findings reflect that the students who are majoring in Computer Science still face challenges in OLTnL even though they have been in the third semester of virtual lectures since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some insights from the lessons learned could be considered if OLTnL continues.",1.0

We live in the knowledge era where knowledge is available almost everywhere in abundance. Therefore, knowledge should not be neglected; it needs to be shared and exchanged. Based on Newman and Conrad (1999), knowledge management is a discipline that seeks to improve the performance of individuals and organizations by maintaining and leveraging the present and future value of knowledge assets. Knowledge portal is an enhancement of the ordinary web portal. While the web portal focuses on offering users a broad array of resources and services, the knowledge portal does not only offer the resources and services, it also acts as a knowledge repository where it will extract and analyze knowledge submitted among its community members. According to Niwa (1990), a knowledge sharing paradigm perceives knowledge supplier as the same set of system users who use the knowledge base system. Hence, knowledge portal is one of the means for knowledge sharing.Based on Giarratano and Riley (1998), there are three ways to represent knowledge: rules, frames and semantic nets. Rules are the most common type of knowledge representation. Rules are easy to implement due to its straightforward structure. However, ordering of the rules is important. Frames represent related knowledge about an object. Frames are easy to understand and they allow unrestrained alteration or cancellation of slots. Frames are suitable to describe a mechanical device.

Therefore, we need to include other quality factors that affect reliability such as usability for improving the reliability in addition to the conventional reliability testing. Actually, the primary objectives of web portals are to provide interactive integration of multiple functions confirming diverse requirements in an efficient way. In this paper, we employ testing profiles to measure the reliability through software operational profile, input space profile and usability profile along with qualitative measures of reliability and usability. Moreover, the case study used for verification is based on a web application that facilitates information and knowledge sharing among its online members. The proposed scheme is compared with the conventional reliability improvement method in terms of failure detection and reliability. The final results unveil that the computation of reliability by using the traditional method (utilizing failure points with the assistance of Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) becomes ineffective under certain situations. Under such situations, the proposed scheme helps to compute the reliability in an effective way. Moreover, the outcomes of the study provide insight recommendations about the testing and measurement of reliability for Web based software or applications.",

Hence, we propose Visual-based Vocabulary Assistance Application (ViVA), a learning application that is developed to assist secondary school students in the higher form to master their English vocabulary. ViVA uses the visual-based approach such as animation, informative diagram, and pictures as the basis of learning to help students understand the learning material easily. In addition, students are also able to measure their understanding by attempting the given assessments. Formative and summative assessments are available through ViVA. The questions of formative assessment are classified according to the topics covered in the learning materials. On the other hand, summative evaluation questions cover all the proposed topics. ViVA also provides the function to check their performance and allows them to track their progress and plan for improvement. Furthermore, the goal of developing ViVA in a Web-based environment is to make it easier for students to access ViVA from any devices. Therefore, ViVA may be readily assessed by students by having the Internet connection and any devices.

Some topics are hardly to be visualized. Thus, this project has developed a mobile application named as Learning Cascading Style Sheets Concepts (CASSCO), which is an educational application that aims to help the secondary school students in understanding the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The targeted audience of CASSCO is the Form 5 students who enroll in the Computer Science course. In brief, CSS is a style sheet language which enables the users or the program authors to decorate their Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to become attractive with colours and different styled fonts as an example. CASSCO will provide the secondary school students with content that will ease them to understand the CSS concepts and they will also be able to test their understanding by the assessments that is based on the topics taught in CASSCO. The assessment marks and reviews are provided to ensure the students are able to track their learning progress and measure how far they have advanced in understanding CSS concepts through CASSCO. Moreover, Flutter is used to develop CASSCO as this technology is globally used due to the richness of sources and stability.

Evolving Paper-Based Activities Approach (EPAA) to Promote Interest in Software Engineering Education,https://www.academia.edu/download/75253910/a025710-110.pdf,"SHAHIDA SULAIMAN, SARINA SULAIMAN, SHARIFAH MASHITA SYED-MOHAMAD, WAHIDAH HUSAIN",,,,,,,,"Software engineering education is vital as an introductory course in computer science or information technology undergraduate programmes. However, it seems to be dull to some educators to teach the concepts as compared to teach courses like programming and database. This phenomenon causes educators to have lack of interest in teaching and in turn affect the interest of learners to grasp the concepts better and relate it with other courses in computer science or information technology. This paper proposes an evolving paper-based activities approach (EPAA) to promote interest in software engineering education among both educators and learners. The approach aims to make software engineering education to be more interesting, engaging and integrated so that learners can appreciate why they learn software engineering course in computer science or information technology programmes. Two groups of students who took the related courses gave the positive feedbacks that the approach increased their interest in learning software engineering mainly in understanding the concept in object-oriented analysis and design using Unified Modeling Language.",

Nonetheless, users frequently experience poor performance in accessing web sites or downloading files primarily when they use mobile devices due to their limited storage, processing, display, power and communication resources.. The common cause ofpoor performance is due to the direct access to the server (eg pitiable performance of server-side applications or during burst crowds) and network infrastructure (eg long geographical distances, network overloads, etc.). Hence, the goal ofthis study is to propose Rough Set (RS) as a knowledge representation for uncertainty in data of client behavior and mobile event specification with resource dependencies to reduce latency by prefetching selected resources to resolve the problems in handling dynamic web pages. Simultaneously, Cultural Algorithms (CA) will be exploited to optimize the performance of proxy caching in accumulating the knowledge between each generation.

These portals do not visualize members’ expertise level effectively and limited members’ information make visualization of members’ expertise level inaccurate. This situation may waste time because new or other SIG portal need to create their own design to visualize their members’ expertise level. We propose expertise knowledge collection and visualization pattern that can be reused when designing a SIG knowledge portal. Our design solution will reduce the burden of portal designer and will visualize members’ expertise level efficiently and accurately.,

By utilizing several technological utilities like cyber-currency and cloud-based developing platforms, crypto-ransomware has gained high popularity among adversaries. Motivated by the monetary revenue, crypto-ransomware developers continuously produce many variants of such malicious programs to evade the detection. Consequently, the rate of crypto-ransomware novel attacks is continuously increasing. As such, it is imperative for detection solutions to be able to discover these novel attacks, also called zero-day attacks. While anomaly detection-based solutions are able to deal with this problem, they suffer the high rate of false alarms. Thus, this paper puts forward a detection model that incorporates anomaly with behavioral detection approaches. In this model, two types of detection estimators were built. The first type is an ensemble of behavioral-based classifiers whereas the second type is an anomaly-based estimator. The decisions of both types of estimators were combined using fusion technique. The proposed model is able to detect the novel attack while maintaining low false alarms rate. By applying the proposed model, the detection rate was increased from 96% to 99% and the false positive rate was as low as 2.4%.",48.0

Ensuring that such an ontology is relevant to a particular domain, however, remains a challenging task to the ontology developer. Motivated by the lack of consistent holistic guidelines to assist development of ontologies that are industry-relevant, the goal of this chapter is to present such an approach. The presented approach is based on the synthesis of existing approaches and varied sources of academic and industry input. The approach follows a typical ontology development cycle and consists of incremental steps that need to be taken to assure industry-relevance of the ontology. To provide a thorough discussion of the approach, the authors utilize a previously completed ontology development project that followed the developed approach. The project was specifically aimed at developing an industry-relevant ontology for the compliance management domain and was based on three main inputs, namely, scholarly articles, industry expert/practitioner input and industry reports. Their experience indicates that the use of the ontology development approach promotes an ontology that is closely aligned with the needs of industry.",

One major departure from related experiments in the literature is that we make use of a dual-task methodology in our experiment. This design offers an abstraction of typical situations where viewers do not have their full attention focused on visualization (e.g., in meetings and lectures). The secondary task introduces “divided attention”, and makes the effects of visual embellishments more observable. In addition, it also serves as additional masking in memory-based trials.

The physical properties of muscles, emotions, or the fluid properties with sweating and tears initiators are incorporated. The action units (AUs) of facial action coding system are merged with autonomous AUs to create expressions including sadness, anger with blushing, happiness with blushing, and fear. Fluid effects such as sweat and tears are simulated using the particle system and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods which are combined with facial animation technique to produce complex facial expressions. The effects of oxygenation of the facial skin color appearance are measured using the pulse oximeter system and the 3D skin analyzer.

Although most Nepenthes species have unique morphologies, their vegetative stages are identical, making identification based on morphology difficult. DNA barcoding is seen as a potential tool for plant identification, with small DNA segments amplified for species identification. In this study, three barcode loci; ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), intergenic spacer 1 (ITS1) and intergenic spacer 2 (ITS2) and the usefulness of the ITS1 and ITS2 secondary structure for the molecular identification of Nepenthes species were investigated. An analysis of barcodes was conducted using BLASTn, pairwise genetic distance and diversity, followed by secondary structure prediction. The findings reveal that PCR and sequencing were both 100% successful. The present study showed the successful amplification of all targeted DNA barcodes at different sizes. Among the three barcodes, rbcL was the least efficient as a DNA barcode compared to ITS1 and ITS2. The ITS1 nucleotide analysis revealed that the ITS1 barcode had more variations compared to ITS2. The mean genetic distance (K2P) between them was higher for interspecies compared to intraspecies. The results showed that the DNA barcoding gap existed among Nepenthes species, and differences in the secondary structure distinguish the Nepenthes. The secondary structure generated in this study was found to successfully discriminate between the Nepenthes species, leading to enhanced resolutions.",

An empirical study on using visual metaphors in visualization,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3849224,"Rita Borgo, Alfie Abdul-Rahman, F Mohamed, Philip W Grant, Irene Reppa, Luciano Floridi, Min Chen",2012/7/1,Available at SSRN 3849224,,,,,,"In written and spoken communications, metaphors are often used as an aid to help convey abstract or less tangible concepts. However, the benefits of using visual metaphors in visualization have so far been inconclusive. In this work, we report an empirical study to evaluate hypotheses that visual metaphors may aid memorization, visual search and concept comprehension. One major departure from previous metaphor-related experiments in the literature is that we make use of a dual-task methodology in our experiment. This design offers an abstraction of typical situations where viewers do not have their full attention focused on visualization (eg, in meetings and classes). The use of the secondary task introduces “divided attention”, and makes the effects of visual metaphors more observable. In addition, it also serves as additional masking in memory-based trials. The results of this study show that visual metaphors can help participants better remember the information depicted in visualization. On the other hand, visual metaphors can have a negative impact on the speed of visual search. The results also show a complex pattern as to the benefits of visual metaphors in helping participants grasp key concepts from visualization.",

Implementation of indoor camera localization problems using a Convolutional neural network (CNN) or Recurrent neural network (RNN) is more challenging from a large image dataset because of the internal structure of CNN or RNN. We can choose a preferable CNN or RNN variant based on the problem type and size of the dataset. CNN is the most flexible method for implementing indoor localization problems. Despite CNN's suitability for hyper-parameter selection, it requires a lot of training images to achieve high accuracy. In addition, overfitting leads to a decrease in accuracy. Introduce RNN, which accurately keeps input images in internal memory to solve these problems. Longshort-term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Gated recurrent unit (GRU) are three variants of RNN. We may choose the most appropriate RNN variation based on the problem type and dataset. In this study, we can recommend which variant is effective for training more speedily and which variant produces more accurate results. Vanishing gradient issues also affect RNNs, making it difficult to learn more data. Overcome the gradient vanishing problem by utilizing LSTM. The BiLSTM is an advanced version of the LSTM and is capable of higher performance than the LSTM. A more advanced RNN variant is GRU which is computationally more efficient than an LSTM.

Position tracking has been widely used in medical applications, especially in imaging navigation. Its use in 2D to 3D US imaging has transformed the slice view limitation into higher dimension data with bigger clinical impacts. As game controller sensors may produce positional and orientation information, it is potential to upgrade their functional capabilities to generate a low-cost and portable position tracker for US imaging. The study consisted of acquisition from game controller sensors, position tracker and US imaging synchronization, and 2D to 3D reconstruction. The position tracker acquisition was accomplished by extracting and fusing signals from accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer sensors to obtain positional and orientation data. Quaternion method was used to coordinate the positions and orientations by relating the number theory and algebra. It was preferred due to its stability and eciency in solving gimbal lock problem. The synchronization was performed by combining acquisition of both systems in the same movement and time. The synchronized data was further reconstructed to produce 3D US volume. Our experiments included game controller position tracker testing and 3D US reconstruction implementation on phantom. The results confirmed that the game controller performance was closely aligned with that ofin robot arm. Also, the 2D to 3D US reconstruction implementation has revealed promising outcomes.",

Subsequently, the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance scheme exhibits an exponentially increasing range of backoff times. These approaches are not only inefficient but result in high latency and increased power consumption. In this article, the concept of class of service (CS) was adopted to prioritize heterogeneous data (real-time and non-real-time), resulting in an optimized prioritized backoff MAC scheme called Class of Service Traffic Priority-based Medium Access Control (CSTP-MAC). This scheme classifies data into high priority data (HPD) and low priority data (LPD) by computing backoff times with expressions peculiar to the data priority class.

Dexterous manipulating skills enable robots to assist humans in accomplishing various tasks that might be too dangerous or difficult to do. This requires robots to intelligently plan and control the actions of their hands and arms. Object manipulation is a vital skill in several robotic tasks. However, it poses a challenge to robotics. The motivation behind this review paper is to review and analyze the most relevant studies on learning-based object manipulation in clutter. Unlike other reviews, this review paper provides valuable insights into the manipulation of objects using deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) in dense clutter. Various studies are examined by surveying existing literature and investigating various aspects, namely, the intended applications, the techniques applied, the challenges faced by researchers, and the recommendations adopted to overcome these obstacles. In this review, we divide deep RL-based robotic manipulation tasks in cluttered environments into three categories, namely, object removal, assembly and rearrangement, and object retrieval and singulation tasks. We then discuss the challenges and potential prospects of object manipulation in clutter.

Several models have been proposed in the literature for the DRF field, which generally discusses DRF from a reactive forensic perspective; however, the proactive forensic perspective is missing. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel forensic readiness framework called Drone Forensics Readiness Framework (DRFRF) using the design science method. It consists of two stages: (i) proactive forensic stage and (ii) reactive forensic stage. It considers centralized logging of all events of all the applicants within the drone device in preparation for an examination. It will speed up gathering data when an investigation is needed, permitting the forensic investigators to handle the examination and analysis directly. Additionally, digital forensics analysts can increase the possible use of digital evidence while decreasing the charge of performing forensic readiness. Thus, both the time and cost required to perform forensic readiness could be saved. The completeness, logicalness, and usefulness of DRFRF were compared to those of other models already existing in the DRF domain. The results showed the novelty and efficiency of DRFRF and its applicability to the situations before and after drone incidents.",4.0

Brain tumours can heal better if they are diagnosed and treated quickly. When it comes to processing medical images, the deep learning method is essential in aiding humans in diagnosing various diseases. Classifying brain tumours is an essential step that relies heavily on the doctor’s experience and training. A smart system for detecting and classifying these tumours is essential to aid in the non-invasive diagnosis of brain tumours using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images. This work presents a novel hybrid deep learning CNN-based structure to distinguish between three distinct types of human brain tumours through MRI scans. This paper proposes a method that employs a dual approach to classification using deep learning and CNN. The first approach combines the unsupervised classification of an SVM for pattern classification with a pre-trained CNN (ie, SqueezeNet) for feature extraction. The second approach combines the supervised soft-max classifier with a finely tuned SqueezeNet. To evaluate the efficacy of the suggested method, MRI scans of the brain were used to analyse a total of 1937 images of glioma tumours, 926 images of meningioma tumours, 926 images of pituitary tumours, and 396 images of a normal brain. According to the experiment results, the finely tuned SqueezeNet model obtained an accuracy of 96.5%.

However, the mechanism fails to address the heterogeneous nature of data packets traversing the network, as these packets may carry different classes of data with different priority statuses, some real-time (time-sensitive) while others non-real-time (delay-tolerant). The standard Objective Functions (OFs), used by RPL to create routing paths, treat all classes of data as the same, this practice is not only inefficient but results in poor network performance. In this article, the Prioritized Shortest Path Computation Mechanism (PSPCM) is proposed to resolve the data prioritization of heterogeneous data and inefficient power management issues. The mechanism prioritizes heterogeneous data streaming through the network into various priority classes, based on the priority conveyed by the data. The PSPCM mechanism routes the data through the shortest and power-efficient path from the source to the destination node. PSPCM generates routing paths that exactly meet the need of the prioritized data. It outperformed related mechanisms with an average of 91.49% PDR, and average power consumption of 1.37mW which translates to better battery saving and prolonged operational lifetime while accommodating data with varying priorities.",2.0

Dexterous grasping necessitates intelligent visual observation of the target objects by emphasizing the importance of spatial equivariance to learn the grasping policy. In this paper, two significant challenges associated with robotic grasping in both clutter and occlusion scenarios are addressed. The first challenge is the coordination of push and grasp actions, in which the robot may occasionally fail to disrupt the arrangement of the objects in a well-ordered object scenario. On the other hand, when employed in a randomly cluttered object scenario, the pushing behavior may be less efficient, as many objects are more likely to be pushed out of the workspace. The second challenge is the avoidance of occlusion that occurs when the camera itself is entirely or partially occluded during a grasping action. This paper proposes a multi-view change observation-based approach (MV-COBA) to overcome these two problems. The proposed approach is divided into two parts:(1) using multiple cameras to set up multiple views to address the occlusion issue; and (2) using visual change observation on the basis of the pixel depth difference to address the challenge of coordinating push and grasp actions. According to experimental simulation findings, the proposed approach achieved an average grasp success rate of 83.6%, 86.3%, and 97.8% in the cluttered, well-ordered object, and occlusion scenarios, respectively.",2.0

DBFI is a subdomain of the digital forensics domain, which deals with database files and dictionaries to identify, acquire, preserve, examine, analyze, reconstruct, present, and document database incidents. Several frameworks and models have been offered for the DBFI field in the literature. However, these specific models and frameworks have redundant investigation processes and activities. Therefore, this study has two aims:(i) conducting a compressive survey to discover the challenges and issues of the DBFI field and (ii) developing a Unified forensic model for the database forensics field. To this end, the design science research (DSR) method was used in this study. The results showed that the DBFI field suffers from many issues such as the lack of standardization, multidimensional nature, heterogeneity, and ambiguity, making it complex for those working in this domain. In addition, a model was proposed in this paper, called the Unified Forensic Model (UFM), which consists of five main stages: initialization stage, acquiring stage, investigation stage, restoring and recovering stage, and evaluation stage. Each stage has several processes and activities. The applicability of UFM was evaluated from two perspectives: completeness and implementation perspectives. UFM is a novel model covering all existing DBFI models and comprises two new stages: the recovering and restoring stage and the evaluation stage. The proposed UFM is so flexible that any forensic investigator could employ it easily when investigating database incidents.",

Dexterous grasping necessitates intelligent visual observation of the target objects by emphasizing the importance of spatial equivariance to learn the grasping policy. In this paper, two significant challenges associated with robotic grasping in both clutter and occlusion scenarios are addressed. The first challenge is the coordination of push and grasp actions, in which the robot may occasionally fail to disrupt the arrangement of the objects in a well-ordered object scenario. On the other hand, when employed in a randomly cluttered object scenario, the pushing behavior may be less efficient, as many objects are more likely to be pushed out of the workspace. The second challenge is the avoidance of occlusion that occurs when the camera itself is entirely or partially occluded during a grasping action.This paper proposes a multi-view change observation-based approach (MV-COBA) to overcome these two problems. The proposed approach is divided into two parts: 1) using multiple cameras to set up multiple views to address the occlusion issue; and 2) using visual change observation on the",

Prioritize requirements are easy to manage and implement while un-prioritized requirements are costly and consume much time as total estimation time of project can exceed. Because all requirements are depended on each other so total estimation time exceed when requirements wait for pre-requisite requirements. Priority of requirement also increases when other requirements wait for it but assigning low priority to needed requirements will delaying the project. Iteration model is software engineering (SE) process model in which all requirements are not developed at one time but are developed in phases. Only sufficient information or subrequirements of particular user requirement (UR) can be needed for other user requirements (URs) so by implementing only the sufficient requirements in first phase will reduce waiting time. Hence total estimation time of the project will also reduce. In this research work, iteration model approach is used during prioritization to reduce total estimation time of project and to assure timely delivery of project.

The residents in Dungun always suffered from floods since the water overflows to the areas adjoining to the rivers, lakes or dams. The rainfall and evaporation of the area have a large influence on the water level of Dungun River. Therefore, a suitable prediction model is needed to forecast the water level in Dungun River by adopting the ordinary linear regression (OLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) based on hydrological data. However, we need to perform cleansing data of the hydrological data since the original data contain inconsistent data. Based on the experiment, it shows that PLSR is more suitable model rather than OLR and the use of the cleansing data gives higher accuracy than the original data.",12.0

However, requirements are dependent on each other, therefore development of pre-requisite requirements must be carefully timed and should be implemented first. Therefore, assigning importance and priority to some requirements over others is necessary so that requirements can be available on time to developers.

The design of research method consists of Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) technique based on spanning trees. Through spanning trees, dependent requirements were linked in hierarchical structure and then AHP were applied.

Core assets, which are developed for reuse in domain engineering, are selected for product specific derivation in application engineering. Decision making support during product derivation is crucial to assist in making multiple decisions during product specific derivation. Multiple decisions are to be resolved at the architectural level as well as the detailed design level, address the need for assisting the decision making process during core asset derivation. Architectural level decision making is based on imprecise, uncertain and subjective nature of stakeholder for making architectural selection based on nonfunctional requirements (NFR). Furthermore, detail design level involves the selection of suitable features which have the rationale behind each decision. The rationale for the selection, if not documented properly, will also result in loss of tacit knowledge. Therefore, a multi-attribute architecture design decision technique is proposed to overcome the above mentioned problem. The technique combines Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with lightweight architecture design decision documentation to support the decision making during core asset derivation. We demonstrate our approach using the case study of Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR).

In particular, the effectiveness of generating test cases becomes a crucial task, where there is an increment of source codes and a rapid change of the requirements. Therefore, the selection of effective test cases becomes problematic, when the test cases are redundant and having common requirements. Thus, new challenges arose to reduce the unnecessary test cases and find common requirements that would increase the cost and maintenance of the software testing process. To address this issue, this study proposed a technique that minimized the test cases and requirement attributes, without compromising on fault detection capability.

Support vector regression model is an effective forecasting tool to forecast streamflow as it is able to capture the nonlinearity in the data and attain the global optimum parameters in the forecasted model. However, the efficiency of SVR might be hindered by noise that typically exists in any hydrological time series data through random influences and inaccuracies in recording. Thus, this condition could compromise the quality of input data into SVR. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of forecasting monthly streamflow data using different settings of SVR in two ways. First, we use different variations of wavelet denoising technique using different selections of wavelet decomposition levels and mother wavelets in order to preserve information and reduce distortion of the original time series. For this purpose, we measured the impact of six different wavelets on SVR namely Daubechies of type db3, db4, db5, db6 and db7 with two different levels of decomposition which are level 3 and level 4. There is more information that may contribute to better performance of the model when the decomposition level is increase. Then, the data are applied using radial basis function (RBF) by performing K-fold cross-validation to obtain the optimal parameter for kernel function in forecasting streamflow.

The aim of an alpha test is to get early feedback from users and to identify bugs in order for improvements to be made. Instead of carrying out regular alpha test activities, System Usability Scale (SUS) method is used in the alpha test. The main aim of this paper is to report on how the SUS is applied as a part of an acceptance test for a newly built multiplatforms application, known as Dengue-Entomological Surveillance (DES) system. The DES system is built both as an interactive mobile application and a hybrid web application that allows its end-users; Entomology and Pest Unit (EPU) team from State Health Office of Ministry of Health of Malaysia, to collect real-time data encompassing data from ovitraps installation, automatized data analysis, as well as, entomological surveillance operations' reports concerning dengue outbreaks. Experimental design and procedures of the alpha test were carefully planned and successfully implemented. Participants'(EPU team) demographic data, execution and completion time for given tasks, and user experience on DES system comprising usability, as well as, general comments and feedback from users were collected and analysed. The findings of the alpha test reveal a higher percentage total of SUS score usability of the web-based application with 72.75%, as compared to 68.75% for the mobile-based application.",1.0
An Enhanced UML Consistency Checker Using Logical Approach,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42954033.pdf,Noraini Ibrahim,2013/5,,,,,,,"In developing an information system, software specification is one of the common activities to any system development methodologies. A software model is among the ways to specify software functionalities and constraints. It is constructed as a way to understand the software prior to actually building or modifying it, and it can help in reducing defect density in the software design. In an object oriented based development, Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a famous language used for visualising, capturing and documenting software requirements. Currently, UML has a set of fourteen (14) diagrams that permits modellers to describe different aspects of a system. Each diagram comprises of graphical notations that adhered to UML elements. These situations rendered UML model vulnerable to consistency problems where two or more overlapping elements of different diagrams are not jointly satisfiable. Even though the research in consistency between UML diagrams is rapidly increased, there is still lack of researches of consistency based on use case in use case diagram. UML consistency management is becoming a difficult task because UML itself lacks of formal syntax and semantics and current approaches using simplified version of UML make their approaches hard to implement in CASE (Computer-aided Software Engineering) tool environment. Due to those problems, this research introduces formal syntactical rules to UML elements of four (4) most popular UML diagrams used by UML practitioners: use case diagram, activity diagram, sequence diagram and class diagram. Referring to the formal syntactical rules for UML elements, formal …",1.0

Object-oriented approach is convenient to facilitate real situation and works well in complicated system. The approach has a mature Unified Modelling Language (UML) with 13 diagrams in modelling of the system. Class Diagrams are the most diagrams created during analysis and design and are the only diagrams that have represented data semantic. In object-oriented technique, one class in class diagram will be transferred to one table in schema table. However, this technique has led to data redundancy when the schema tables are used in defining the database. Many researchers are doing research to find the best solution to defining database structure from class diagram. Since, the mature approach is not well defined; we propose to consider three main steps in creating schema table from class diagram. First step is based on the class information in class diagram. Second step is to consider the user interface. Last step is embedding of the data sanitization concept to remove unused attributes in schema tables. The result from this research will be congruent with the third normal form. The database structure is reflected to user view and it will accelerate accessing time accordingly. Furthermore, it will increase the usage of database storage with removing unnecessary data stored in it. Therefore, we have suggested a rule as a well form in designing the schema tables from class diagram.",1.0

It will produce a system artifact called a system model. In object–oriented based software development, a system model can be developed by using Unified Modeling Language (UML). UML is a modeling language for specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of systems. It consists of 13 diagrams that can be used to describe the different views of a system. Each diagram has its own syntax and semantics. The syntax or abstract syntax is the notations for each element of the diagrams, whereas the semantics is the meaning of the notations. The huge complexity of UML specification that content multi diagrams and notations, and lack of formal semantics decrease the quality of system models produced. It will lead to wrong interpretations and inconsistency between models. Therefore, a precise meaning of UML diagrams is very important in order to have a common understanding of their meaning.

Lack of security is a primary concern of the current UTHM voting system, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repetition. Besides, the voting process can be inconvenient due to the limited number of polling stations. The distance between these polling stations and college residences causes difficulties for the students to go to a polling station. Moreover, students have to line up for some time before they can vote, which means that some of them leave without even voting.

An external adapter can also amplify signal reception from hotspots. The problem is how users consider using an external wireless adapter or just an onboard wireless adapter when there are many networks interfering with the weak signal strength of the access point. The method is implemented by measuring the value of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The purpose of this study is to compare the received signal strength in conditions where the signal before interference and after experiencing interference (interference). Meanwhile, the measured RSSI value is divided into four floors and with different distances for each floor. Each floor is measured by five distances. The average value of signal strength at a distance of 10 meters is-74 dBm using the onboard wireless adapter and-69 dBm using a USB wireless adapter. The value obtained after the interference is-75 dBm and the USB wireless adapter gets-61 dBm. The reduction of the RSSI value between interference and non-interference is 3%.

Mutation generates the fault version called mutants. Mutation makes small changes in the code. The output is analysed if it is different from the original program. Then, the mutant can be killed, or otherwise the mutant said as live. This mutation technique will be used on Graphical User Interface (GUI), which plays an important role in testing the interaction between user and software. Using this mutation technique, it may detect more faults on Graphical User Interface (GUI) during testing to produce a good test suite. The problem with the mutation technique is that it is expensive, thus new refinement technique, such as mutant selection, is proposed. The lack of mutant selection decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of testing due to a random selection of a small subset of mutants and reducing some operator mutants from the test set for execution. Regardless of this, reducing the number of mutants for execution is still important. Thus, this paper proposed new refinement techniques for improving mutant selection in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of testing known as Similarity Relation and Conditional Entropy. Similarity Relation classifies the same mutants in the same class to avoid redundancy, while Conditional Entropy selects mutant operator based on the classification of mutants. The results show that Similarity Relation can reduce 85% of mutants, while Conditional Entropy reduces 80% of mutant operator with 100% defect fault capabilities.

The effectiveness of generating test cases becomes a crucial task where there are an increment of source code and the rapid change of the requirement. Therefore, to select the effective test cases become a problem when the test cases are redundant. It creates a new challenge on how to reduce the unnecessary test cases that will increase the cost and maintenance of the software testing process. Thus, this paper proposed the usage of entropy in detecting and removing the redundancy of test cases generated from Control Flow Graph (CFG).

It has also been argued that with the use of digital communication, the meanings of visual and verbal data can be easily manipulated rendering them unreliable. As such, a close and critical reading of the text is required to discover what is hidden, absent, or inconsistent with it. In a deconstruction of a multimodal digital composition of a poem that involves revisioning of history, this paper privileges the absences of cultural and historical texts to signify socio-political issues. An eclectic use of theoretical concepts on meaning-making, especially those proposed by Kress and van Leeuwen, Foucault and Baudrillard, constructs the discussion of the analysis. The digital poem entitled ‘Revenge’is deconstructed to further discover such absence in the text. The findings reveal that language and images are used by the learner as a source of power to negotiate the boundaries of identity. It has also been discovered that the message in rhetoric and visuals complement each other to support the process of meaning-making.",

Nevertheless, the use of generic natural language has potential for the issues of unclear and inconsistent requirements. These issues may result from the diverse interpretations by the stakeholders or other various sources of documents and artefacts. The main objective of this paper was to discuss the definition and application of predefined boilerplates to specify the requirements in the form of natural language statements. The proposed boilerplates were defined and classified based on two main types of requirements, namely functional and non-functional (performance, constraints, and specific quality). Two methods have been applied to evaluate the research results; the applicability of the predefined boilerplates was demonstrated using two different case studies, and the usability aspect is evaluated through synthetic environment experimentation using human respondents. As a summary, the predefined boilerplates were found helpful, especially among novice requirement engineers to express and specify their requirements in a consistent manner and a standardized way, relatively able to improve the quality of the natural language statements.",

Time Series Support Vector Regression Models with Missing Data Treatments for Water Level Prediction,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42916076.pdf,Noraini Ibrahim,2014/5,,,,,,,"Rise in water level is an important issue because it can be used as an indicator for flood alert. The water level of a river is dependent upon variables such as the month, volume of rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and surface wind. The main purpose of this research is to find a suitable method to predict the water level of Galas River in Kelantan to anticipate flood. In this research, secondary data on water level of Galas River was collected from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia and Malaysian Meteorological Department. Some of the data were missing in certain months, thus these data were replaced by the use of means and linear regression based on the related months in other years as treatments of these missing data. Both these treatments were included in the methods to analyse data. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and SVR-based time series regression were used to analyse the data. Using the MLR analysis, multicollinearity was detected and addressed by applying PLSR. However, this technique which is a linear based model may not be appropriate in a nonlinear case such as the Galas River case. In this study, a nonlinear method, SVR, was applied. Besides that, SVR-based time series regression was proposed to cater for the time-based water level data, and to overcome the issue of linearity and multicollinearity. The result shows that linear regression is a better data treatment in SVR and SVR-based time series regressions. In addition, using Gaussian kernel, the results showed that these regressions have lower mean squared error …",

Therefore, instructors need to be more creative in facilitating the learning, may it be synchronous or asynchronous, by providing motivating activities in a cooperative way. Cooperative learning (CL) is defined by Johnson & Johnson (1987) as an instructional method that uses small groups for the learner to work together for maximizing their learning. The construction of knowledge using CL involves five principles which are positive interdependence, individual accountability, faceto-face interaction, interpersonal skills, and group processing (Johnson & Johnson, 1998). A number of studies have shown the impact of CL on electrical engineering students. For example, Millymaki (2012) noted an improvement in learning motivation after implementing CL to advanced electrical engineering work. Thus, implementing CL for online learning is expected to positively impact students’ learning motivation.

Besides that, it requires a clear understanding of the whole software's role and interactions with the system. Identifying hazards is an important task in safety. It forms the basic foundation of the safety requirements, the system design and the system implementation. Hazard analysis needs to be carried out at the earliest stage of system development to avoid serious damage and accidents from happening. Identifying potential hazards helps to reduce overall development time, save project costs and efforts. This paper aims to validate the usability of the System Modeling Language (SysML) Parametric Diagram for safety evaluation. The described method is still an early attempt. The integration between the Parametric Diagram and safety analysis techniques provides a common language or platform for system engineers and customers to understand the whole system safety evaluation model and process.

Furthermore, the existing alert correlation systems deal with a huge amount of data that contains null values, incomplete information, and irrelevant features causing the analysis of the alerts to be tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, this paper focuses on selecting accurate and significant features of alerts that are appropriate to represent the attack steps, thus, enhancing the structural-based alert correlation model. A two-tier feature selection method is proposed to obtain the significant features. The first tier aims at ranking the subset of features based on high information gain entropy in decreasing order. The‏ second tier extends additional features with a better discriminative ability than the initially ranked features.

They generate a high volume of low-quality intrusion alerts when attack scenarios have taken place. Worst, NIDSs cannot extract or even predict sequence of attack scenarios. Thus, alert post-processing or known as Alert Correlation (AC) is much needed to derive current system security. AC aims to identify the complete relationship among intrusion alerts that can reveal the attacker strategy (ie, sequence of attack scenarios). Current works do not provide attack prediction and proactive actions when attack scenarios were launched. Prediction can assists early warning and prevention to avoid the attack from escalating and damaging the network.

However, the privacy of outsourced data is a serious concern. Most data owners are using anonymization-based techniques to prevent identity and attribute disclosures to avoid privacy leakage before outsourced data for mining over the cloud. In addition, data collection and dissemination in a resource-limited network such as sensor cloud require efficient methods to reduce privacy leakage. The main issue that caused identity disclosure is quasi-identifier (QID) linking. But most researchers of anonymization methods ignore the identification of proper QIDs. This reduces the validity of the used anonymization methods and may thus lead to a failure of the anonymity process. This paper introduces a new quasi-identifier recognition algorithm that reduces identity disclosure which resulted from QID linking. The proposed algorithm is comprised of two main stages: (1) attribute classification (or QID recognition) and (2) QID dimension identification. The algorithm works based on the reidentification of risk rate for all attributes and the dimension of QIDs where it determines the proper QIDs and their suitable dimensions. The proposed algorithm was tested on a real dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces privacy leakage and maintains the data utility compared to recent related algorithms.",6.0

In the study fertilized eggs were categorized in 5 groups incubated at standard parameters. On 4 th day of incubation, group1 and 2 were injected with Ciprofloxacin (30 and 60 mg/egg respectively). Group 3 was pinched with needle only and group 4 was injected with sterilized saline solution. Group 5 was kept as a control, without any injection or pinching.Results: On the 18th day of incubation, the growth of embryos was monitored. Hemorrhages on neck and head areas were noticed in treated group treated with 60 mg/egg. Low body weight along with the defective beak and nail formation was noticed. No other clear external deformity was observed in any treated and normal groups. It can be inferred that embryotoxic effects of ciprofloxacin cannot be ignored. High or repeated doses can reduce the turnover number of successful hatching chicks and the consumption of antibiotics treated chicken can lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance in humans.Conclusion: It can be concluded that recommended dose limit is very important to avoid the harmful effect of antibiotics and chemicals. Embryotoxic effect of ciprofloxacin cannot be ignored. Use of antibiotic/s in poultry and live stocks should be carefully monitored and judged on medical basis; also its use for growth promotion should be discontinued.",

An Effective Attack Scenario Construction Model based on Attack Steps and Stages Identification,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08662,"Taqwa Ahmed Alhaj, Maheyzah Md Siraj, Anazida Zainal, Inshirah Idris, Anjum Nazir, Fatin Elhaj, Tasneem Darwish",2021/10/16,arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.08662,,,,,,"A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a network security technology for detecting intruder attacks. However, it produces a great amount of low-level alerts which makes the analysis difficult, especially to construct the attack scenarios. Attack scenario construction (ASC) via Alert Correlation (AC) is important to reveal the strategy of attack in terms of steps and stages that need to be launched to make the attack successful. In most of the existing works, alerts are correlated by classifying the alerts based on the cause-effect relationship. However, the drawback of these works is the identification of false and incomplete correlations due to the infiltration of raw alerts. To address this problem, this work proposes an effective ASC model to discover the complete relationship among alerts. The model is successfully experimented using two types of datasets, which are DARPA 2000, and ISCX2012. The Completeness and Soundness of the proposed model are measured to evaluate the overall correlation effectiveness.",

Today, consumers take confidence in e-commerce platforms like amazon and eBay for comprehensive understanding of products and services when making a purchase decision. Here the web or user-generated content from consumers of such products and services, known as reviews, are exploited by spam reviewers to falsely promote or downgrade some targeted products. Despite potential solutions, Identifying and preventing review spam are still one of the top challenges faced by web search engines today. Therefore, in the quest to provide a more improved and efficient classification of review spam, this research probed different techniques in order to find most effective solution to spam detection. The research employed three base classifiers, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression to form ensemble classifiers complimented with Arching classifier. The Arching classifier performs the weighted voting that produces the final class label with performance and accuracy higher than either of the individual base classifiers. Cross-validation is used as evaluation metrics to measure the performance or effectiveness of the ensemble classifiers while the experimental results shows that the ensemble classifiers achieve the best results compared to the single based classifier in terms of Precision, Recall, F1-measure and Accuracy.",

Besides describing the spatio-temporal contagion risk of the virus, ultimately, it seeks to test the hypothesis that higher population density results in exacerbated COVID-19 virulence in the community. The population density of 143 districts in Malaysia, as per data from Malaysia’s 2010 population census, was plotted against cumulative COVID-19 cases and infection rates of COVID-19 cases, which were obtained from Malaysia’s Ministry of Health official website. The data of these three variables were collected between 19 January 2020 and 31 December 2020. Based on the observations, districts that have high population densities and are highly inter-connected with neighbouring districts, whether geographically, socio-economically, or infrastructurally, tend to experience spikes in COVID-19 cases within weeks of each other. Using a parametric approach of the Pearson correlation, population density was found to have a moderately strong relationship to cumulative COVID-19 cases (p-value of 0.000 and R2 of 0.415) and a weak relationship to COVID-19 infection rates (p-value of 0.005 and R2 of 0.047).

A common problem related to the microarray data is that the size of genes is essentially larger than the number of samples. Although SVM is capable of handling a large number of genes, better accuracy of classification can be obtained using a small number of gene subset. This research proposed Multiple Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (MSVMRFE) as a gene selection to identify the small number of informative genes. This method is implemented in order to improve the performance of SVM during classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on two different datasets of gene expression which are leukemia and lung cancer. In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed method, some methods such as Random Forest and C4. 5 Decision Tree are compared in this paper. The result shows that this MSVM-RFE is effective in reducing the number of genes in both datasets thus providing a better accuracy for SVM in cancer classification.",17.0

The proposed SIR model was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the official press statements to closely reflect the observed epidemic trend in Malaysia. The proposed model is aimed to provide an accurate predictive information for decision makers in assessing the public health and social measures related to COVID-19 epidemic.MethodsThe SIR model was fitted to the data by minimizing a weighted loss function; the sum of the residual sum of squares (RSS) of infected, removed and total cases. Optimized beta (β),), gamma (γ) parameter values) parameter values and the starting value of susceptible individuals (N) were obtained.ResultsThe SIR model post-MCO indicates the peak of infection on 10 April 2020, less than 100 active cases by 8 July 2020, less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, and close to zero daily new case by 22 July 2020, with a total of 6562 infected cases.

However, the drawback of using clustering techniques is the inability to identify an optimal number of potential clusters beforehand. Several existing optimization techniques can address the issue. Besides, clustering validation can predict the possible number of potential clusters and hence increase the chances of identifying biologically informative genes. This paper reviews and provides examples of existing methods for clustering genes, optimization of the objective function, and clustering validation. Clustering techniques can be categorized into partitioning, hierarchical, grid-based, and density-based techniques. We also highlight the advantages and the disadvantages of each category. To optimize the objective function, here we introduce the swarm intelligence technique and compare the performances of other methods. Moreover, we discuss the differences of measurements between internal and external criteria to validate a cluster quality. We also investigate the performance of several clustering techniques by applying them on a leukemia dataset. The results show that grid-based clustering techniques provide better classification accuracy; however, partitioning clustering techniques are superior in identifying prognostic markers of leukemia. Therefore, this review suggests combining clustering techniques such as CLIQUE and k-means to yield high-quality gene clusters.",13.0

More often than not, mechanical cooling, which is an energy consuming component, contributes to outdoor heat dissipation that leads to an urban heat island effect. Alternatively, encouraging natural ventilation can eliminate heat from the indoor environment. Unfortunately, with static outdoor air conditioning and lack of windows in terraced houses, the conventional ventilation technique does not work well, even for houses with an air well. Hence, this research investigated ways to maximize natural ventilation in terraced housing by exploring the air well configurations. By adopting an existing single storey terraced house with an air well, located in Kuching, Sarawak, the existing indoor environmental conditions and thermal performance were investigated and monitored using scientific equipment, namely HOBO U12 air temperature and air humidity, the HOBO U12 anemometer and the Delta Ohm HD32.3 Wet Bulb Globe Temperature meter. For this parametric study, the DesignBuilder software was utilized. The field study illustrated that there is a need to improve indoor thermal comfort. Thus, the study further proposes improvement strategies to the existing case study house.

There are five common molecular subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A, luminal B, basal, ERBB2, and normal-like. Previous investigations showed that pathway-based microarray analysis could help in the identification of prognostic markers from gene expressions. For example, directed random walk (DRW) can infer a greater reproducibility power of the pathway activity between two classes of samples with a higher classification accuracy. However, most of the existing methods (including DRW) ignored the characteristics of different cancer subtypes and considered all of the pathways to contribute equally to the analysis. Therefore, an enhanced DRW (eDRW+) is proposed to identify breast cancer prognostic markers from multiclass expression data. An improved weight strategy using one-way ANOVA (F-test) and pathway selection based on the greatest reproducibility power is proposed in eDRW+. The experimental results show that the eDRW+ exceeds other methods in terms of AUC. Besides this, the eDRW+ identifies 294 gene markers and 45 pathway markers from the breast cancer datasets with better AUC. Therefore, the prognostic markers (pathway markers and gene markers) can identify drug targets and look for cancer subtypes with clinically distinct outcomes.",3.0

Cancer markers can be determined by manually testing every gene or pathway in the wet lab or using the text mining automation method. The use of text mining techniques effectively investigates hidden information and gathers new knowledge from many existing sources. Unfortunately, querying relevant text to excavate important information is a challenging task. PubMed text data mining is one of the applications that help explore potential cancer markers as the trend of scientific articles in PubMed is steadily increased. Besides, it can support biologists to concentrate on the identified small set of genes or pathways.

Therefore, this paper drawing on field measurement investigates natural ventilation performance in terraced housing with an air-well system. The key concern as to what extent the current air-well system serving as a ventilator is effective to provide better thermal performance is to be addressed. By adopting an existing single-story air-welled terrace house, indoor environmental conditions and thermal performance were monitored and measured using HOBO U12 air temperature and humidity, the HOBO U12 anemometer, and the Delta Ohm HD32. 3 Wet Bulb Globe Temperature meter for a six-month duration.

The proposed SIR model was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the official press statements to closely reflect the observed epidemic trend in Malaysia. The proposed model is aimed to provide an accurate predictive information for decision makers in assessing the public health and social measures related to COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: The SIR model was fitted to the data by minimizing a weighted loss function; the sum of the residual sum of squares (RSS) of infected, removed and total cases. Optimized beta (β),), gamma (c) parameter values and the starting value of susceptible individuals (N) were obtained. Results: The SIR model post-MCO indicates the peak of infection on 10 April 2020, less than 100 active cases by 8 July 2020, less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, and close to zero daily new case by 22 July 2020, with a total of 6562 infected cases.

In Malaysia, the most common forms of stealing electricity are tapping electricity directly from the distribution feeder and manipulating the meter reading via tampering. Refuse to pay bills also one of the problem contributors. Many electric utilities face this problems, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) as the largest electric utility in Malaysia, is no exception. To counter the power theft problem, disconnecting the offenders’ electric supply is a popular approach attempted by TNB for many years. However, this has caused a lot of hazardous events such as injury and potentially loss of life. Therefore, in this paper, a more practical and safer solution is proposed to counter this issue, in which a Distribution Board Remote Switch Control (DBRSC) control approach is proposed. To design this DBRSC, an Arduino Uno microprocessor was used to communicate with an MIT V3 smartphone app using MIT App Inventor Software. From the experimental test, it has been found that the proposed DBRSC unit has been successfully designed, developed, and functioning well in disconnecting and reconnecting the electrical supply remotely. This DBRSC also has been proven works well for both single and three-phase distribution systems. It is therefore, as implication, TNB’s technicians able to cut the electricity connection of the electricity thefts’ premises and houses easier and safer as the electrical connection can be switched off/on from the installed DBRSC on the substation posts on the streets.",

On top of that, medical images segmentation is challenging due to the presence of weakly correlated and ambiguous multiple regions of interest. A few bio-inspired algorithms were developed to efficiently generate optimum threshold values for the process of segmenting such images. Their exhaustive search nature makes them computationally expensive when extended to multilevel thresholding, thus, this research is keen to solve the optimum threshold problems. This paper proposed an enhancement of image segmentation algorithms based on Otsu’s method by incorporating Cuckoo Search (CS) method for Lévy flight generation while simultaneously modifying and optimizing it to work on CT, MRI or mammogram image scanners, specifically to detect breast cancer.

Recently, reducing the motion artefact from ECG signal has gained the interest of many researchers. Due to the overlapping nature of the motion artefact with the ECG signal, it is difficult to reduce motion artefact without distorting the original ECG signal. However, the application of an adaptive noise canceler has shown that it is effective in reducing motion artefacts if the appropriate noise reference that is correlated with the noise in the ECG signal is available. Unfortunately, the noise reference is not always correlated with motion artefact. Consequently, filtering with such a noise reference may lead to contaminating the ECG signal. In this paper, a two-stage filtering motion artefact reduction algorithm is proposed. In the algorithm, two methods are proposed, each of which works in one stage. The weighted adaptive noise filtering method (WAF) is proposed for the first stage. The acceleration derivative is used as motion artefact reference and the Pearson correlation coefficient between acceleration and ECG signal is used as a weighting factor. In the second stage, a recursive Hampel filter-based estimation method (RHFBE) is proposed for estimating the ECG signal segments, based on the spatial correlation of the ECG segment component that is obtained from successive ECG signals. Real-World dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to the conventional adaptive filter.

In this paper, we take the technology a step towards real-world implementation by proposing a set of adaptive and privacy-preserving mechanisms that can be incorporated into existing encounter-based routing protocols to reduce summary vector sizes without compromising delivery guarantees.

Decreasing and balancing the energy consumption of nodes can be employed to increase network lifetime. In cluster-based WSNs, one objective of applying clustering is to decrease the energy consumption of the network. In fact, the clustering technique will be considered effective if the energy consumed by sensor nodes decreases after applying clustering, however, this aim will not be achieved if the cluster size is not properly chosen. Therefore, in this paper, the energy consumption of nodes, before clustering, is considered to determine the optimal cluster size. A two-stage Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to determine the optimal interval of cluster size and derive the exact value from the interval. Furthermore, the energy hole is an inherent problem which leads to a remarkable decrease in the network’s lifespan. This problem stems from the asynchronous energy depletion of nodes located in different layers of the network. For this reason, we propose Circular Motion of Mobile-Sink with Varied Velocity Algorithm (CM2SV2) to balance the energy consumption ratio of cluster heads (CH).

We studied the stocks of 10 top companies, whose data include historical stock prices, with MLlib models such as linear regression, generalized linear regression, random forest, and decision tree. We implemented naive Bayes and logistic regression classification models. Experimental results suggest that linear regression, random forest, and generalized linear regression provide an accuracy of 80%–98%. The experimental results of the decision tree did not well predict share price movements in the stock market.",61.0

Knee osteoarthritis is a type of arthritis and a leading cause of disability worldwide. The middle of the knee contains a vital portion, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It is necessary to diagnose the ACL ruptured tears early to avoid surgery. The study aimed to perform a comparative analysis of machine learning models to identify the condition of three ACL tears. In contrast to previous studies, this study also considers imbalanced data distributions as machine learning techniques struggle to deal with this problem. The paper applied and analyzed four machine learning classification models, namely, random forest (RF), categorical boosting (Cat Boost), light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), and highly randomized classifier (ETC) on the balanced, structured dataset of ACL. After oversampling a hyperparameter adjustment, the above four models have achieved an average accuracy of 95.72%, 94.98%, 94.98%, and 98.26%. There are 2070 observations and eight features in the collection of three diagnosis ACL classes after oversampling. The area under curve value was approximately 0.998, respectively. Experiments were performed using twelve machine learning algorithms with imbalanced and balanced datasets. However, the accuracy of the imbalanced dataset has remained under 76% for all twelve models.

Thus, one needs a new sequential resampling algorithm that is flexible enough to allow it to be used with various computing devices. Therefore, this paper formulated a new single distribution resampling called the adaptive memory size-based single distribution resampling (AMSSDR). This resampling method integrates traditional variation resampling and traditional resampling in one architecture. The algorithm changes the resampling algorithm using the memory in a computing device. This helps the developer formulate a particle filter without over considering the computing devices’ memory utilisation during the development of different particle filters. At the start of the operational process, it uses the AMSSDR selector to choose an appropriate resampling algorithm (for example, rounding copy resampling or systematic resampling), based on the current computing devices’ physical memory. If one chooses systematic resampling, the resampling will sample every particle for every cycle. On the other hand, if it chooses the rounding copy resampling, the resampling will sample more than one of each cycle’s particle. This illustrates that the method (AMSSDR) being proposed is capable of switching resampling algorithms based on various physical memory requirements.

In order to effectively utilize any computational platform, information about the components affecting its performance is necessary. Similarly, Hadoop MapReduce’s performance can be enhanced by identifying those factors that can affect its performance. Some researchers provided some schemes for improving total task completion time of big data tasks on Hadoop MapReduce by suitable selection and scheduling of processing units ie mappers. However, reducers are still underexplored for its effect on the total execution time. This paper aimed at evaluation of reducer’s impact on total execution time of big data tasks on Hadoop MapReduce by employing machine learning techniques. The evaluation has been carried out both analytically and experimentally by changing different number of reducers across various types and length of tasks.

However, handwritten signature is not a uniform characteristic such as fingerprint, iris or vein. It may change to several factors; mood, environment and age. Signature Verification System (SVS) is a part of pattern recognition that can be a solution for such situation. The system can be decomposed into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction and verification.

However, very few of them gave a complete cycle of the sketch interpreter which can be used to transform an engineering sketch to a valid solid object.

Both applications are needed to determine whether the given 2D line drawing represent possible or impossible object. In 2008, previous work by Matondang et al., has used line labelling algorithm to validate several 2D line drawings. However, the result shows that line labelling algorithm itself, is not adequate, as the algorithm does not have a validation technique for the result. Therefore, in this research study, it is going to be shown that if a 2D line drawing is valid as a possible object by using the line labelling algorithm, then it can be colored using graph coloring concept with a determine-able minimum numbers of color needed. This is equal in vice versa. By that way, it is said that the 2D line drawings is valid. The expected output from this phase is a valid-labeled of 2D line drawing with different colors at each edge and ready for the reconstruction phase. As a preliminary result, a high programming language MATLAB R2009a and several primitive 2D line drawings has been used and presented in this paper to test the graph coloring concept in labeled 2D line drawing.",1.0

Since then, previous researches on these topics have presented several frameworks to read, analyze, represent, validate, reconstruct, and visualize an object from engineering sketch to a valid solid object. However, very few of them give a complete cycle of the sketch interpreter which can be used to transform an engineering sketch to valid solid object. Once has been done in the recent year is the work by Matondang et al. in 2008. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework for validation of two dimensional (2D) line drawing based on line labeling and graph coloring based algorithm. The proposed framework enhances the complete cycle of a transformation object from engineering sketch to valid solid objects by applying the graph coloring-based algorithm in the validation of 2D line drawing part. The framework consists of five parts: the interpreting of engineering sketch which also known as the image processing part, representing the regular line drawing, validation of the 2D line drawing using line labeling-based algorithm and graph coloring-based algorithm, reconstructing the validated 2D line drawing, and representing the valid 3D solid object. The inputs for the proposed framework are points, lines and junctions of the engineering sketches which are irregular line drawings. This paper stresses on the usage of line labeling and graph coloring based algorithm.

Multi-omics data is one of the biological data that exhibits high dimensionality, or more commonly known as the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality occurs when the dataset contains many features or attributes but with significantly fewer samples or observations. The study focuses on mitigating the curse of dimensionality by implementing Support Vector Machine–Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) as the selected feature selection method in the lung cancer (LUSC) multi-omics dataset integrated from three single omics dataset comprising genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, and assess the quality of the selected feature subsets using SDAE and VAE deep learning classifiers. In this study, the LUSC datasets first undergo data pre-processing, including checking for missing values, normalization, and removing zero variance features. The cleaned LUSC datasets are then integrated to form a multi-omics dataset. Feature selection was performed on the LUSC multi-omics data using SVM-RFE to select several optimal feature subsets. The five smallest feature subsets (FS) are used in classification using SDAE and VAE neural networks to assess the quality of the feature subsets. The results show that all 5 VAE models can obtain an accuracy and AUC score of 1.000, while only 2 out of 5 SDAE models (FS 1000 & 4000) can do so. 3 out of 5 SDAE models have an AUC score of 0.500, indicating zero capability in separating the binary class labels.

It is hard for the clinician to confirm the patient's condition because the specialist pathology can only make an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, instead of a single omics being used to identify the disease marker, integrating these omics to represent multi-omics brings more advantages in detecting and presenting the phenotype of the cancers. Nowadays, the advancement of computational models, especially deep learning, offered promising approaches in solving high-level omics of data with faster processing speed. Hence, the purpose of this study is to classify cancer and non-cancerous patients using Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) and One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) to evaluate which algorithm classifies better using high correlated multi-omics data. The study employed both computational models to fit the multi-omics dataset. Sarcoma omics datasets used in this study was obtained from the Multi-Omics Cancer Benchmark TCGA Pre-processed Data of ACGT Ron Shamir Lab repository.

By discovering the nick site, the prediction on the function of proteases can be identified and enable humans to control the protein’s hydrolysis by their corresponding protease. This is an important process to control as it can help to control protein replication especially viral proteins. With the rise of computational methods in this era, mainly through the successful application of deep learning in various domains, the application of this method in biological data can help to improve predictions to support the experimental methods. Conventional techniques such as mass spectrometry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis can be supported by computational methods by preparing predictions. Thus reducing the cost of experiment and time taken to identify and predict the protein proteolysis site. This study improves the deep learning algorithm by proposing the Hybrid model of Random Forest+ Deep Neural Network (Hybrid RF+ DNN) to classify proteolysis or nick sites. The classification in this study is compared with other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The proposed method enhances the classification results in identifying the positive and negative nick sites. The RF is a feature-selector that gathers the most important feature before entering the DNN classifier.

Over the years, researchers have identified ADHD as a complicated disorder since it is not directly tested with a standard medical test such as a blood or urine test on the early-stage diagnosis. Apart from the physical symptoms of ADHD, clinical data of ADHD patients show that most of them have learning problems. Therefore, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is considered the most suitable method to determine functional activity in the brain region to understand brain disorders of ADHD. One of the ways to diagnose ADHD is by using deep learning techniques, which can increase the accuracy of predicting ADHD using the fMRI dataset. Past attempts of classifying ADHD based on functional connectivity coefficient using the Deep Neural Network (DNN) result in 95% accuracy. As Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is the most popular in extracting high-level data, this model is applied in this study. This study aims to enhance the performance of VAE to increase the accuracy in classifying ADHD using fMRI data based on functional connectivity analysis. The preprocessed fMRI dataset is used for decomposition to find the region of interest (ROI), followed by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) that calculates the correlation between brain regions and creates functional connectivity matrices for each subject. As a result, the VAE model achieved an accuracy of 75% on classifying ADHD.",

The lack of weld penetration was caused by the formation of aluminum oxide layer, insufficient heating flow, and rapid workpiece rotation. Segregation of major elements such as magnesium and Si varied between the weld zone and base metal, depending on the heat input during welding. Minimum hardness was found in the heat-affected zone/fusion zone boundary, while maximum hardness was found in the fusion zone. Both these extremes cause premature failure of the weld. Such failure, especially embrittlement cracking, was hindered by heat treating 2.5 h at 413 deg and furnace cooling to decrease the hardness variations.--Chem. Abs.",

Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC): Potential Material for Microtechnology Devices,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-287-077-3_76,"Suhaila M Yusuf, Abbas A Dehghani-Sanij, Robert C Richardson",2014,,,,,641-647,Springer Singapore, Ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) is one of the electroactive materials that is being actively investigated. This is due to its potential to become actuators from micro to macro technology. It can be used to develop small actuators such as microgripper or robotic’s fingers for manipulating biology cell as it only requires small voltages to generate significant displacement and will not cause any damage to the object being manipulated. This paper presents the characterization of small-scale IPMC using a vision system and force measurement using a load cell. Six small-scale IPMC samples have been used in the experimental works with voltage excitation of 1–3 V and fixed frequency of 0.5 Hz. Results show that the range of displacement and force generated by the IPMC depends on several parameters such as physical dimensions and voltage magnitude.,

Although there is still no commercial application of IPMC, it has been actively investigated by researchers for the past decade. The IPMC has been identified as a potential material to be used in the specific application of sensor and/or actuation, such as microgripper and micropump. This research deals with the characterisation of small scale IPMC with the ultimate objective to develop a simple microgripper to demonstrate the ability of the IPMC to grasp a micro object. A vision system has been developed to perform image processing to measure the displacement of IPMC. New algorithms of edge detection and displacement measurement have been introduced to characterise the IPMC. Comparison between laser sensor measurements and vision systems measurement has been carried out and the results showed that the vision system is a reliable measurement. Characterisation of small scale IPMC is carried out to prove the claim that miniaturization of IPMC is possible without degrading its performance. The characterisation of the IPMC actuator is divided into two major works - the displacement and blocked force measurements. The results showed that small scale characteristics are in line with the results that have been published by other researchers for larger scale of IPMC, hence supported the claim. The dynamic sensory behaviour of the IPMC has also been characterised. The results showed that the sensor functions are better in terms of …",

A node obtains environmental data through its sensors and sends it to a center called base station through its communicational equipments (antenna) for more processing and final decision making. Resource limitation of a node, including supply resource leads to new challenges for wireless sensor network. With completion of node energy, node exits from network practically and will remain unused. In this situation, some information may not be readable, and coverage disappears in this area. Hence, a technique must be considered that in addition to complete coverage in wireless sensor network, nodes blackout occurs later.

Due to unsupervised nature of clustering problems, choosing a specific algorithm for clustering an unknown dataset is risky and usually fails its objectives. Because of the complexity of this problem and poor performance of basic clustering methods, today the majority of studies in this field are focused on ensemble clustering methods. Diversity and quality of initial results are two of the most important factors that can affect the quality of final results obtained from ensemble clustering, and both factors have been significantly assessed in the recent studies regarding this field. In this paper, a new framework is proposed to improve the efficiency of ensemble clustering. This framework is based on using a subset of initial clusters and selection of this subset plays a crucial role in the performance of the ensemble, so the process of selection is carried out with the help of two intelligent methods. The main idea of the proposed method for the selection of a subset of clusters is to use the stable clusters with the help of intelligent search algorithms.

Wireless sensor networks have unique features that differentiate them from other wireless networks and create special challenges. Non-rechargeable, non-replaceable and limited power supply of the sensor nodes are the main challenges of these networks such that with complete discharge of the node power supply, it will become useless, part of the information may be out of reach and the performance of the network may fall into danger. As coverage is of great importance in the Wireless sensor network, a solution is proposed in this paper. In this method each node is placed in a particular location due to the importance of overall network coverage in WSN and also in order to reduce energy consumption of the system, all the nodes are on standby except one. To establish a duty cycle and prevent the imposition of too much load on a node, the active node that is responsible for sensing and maintaining the coverage in the area, may be replaced by another active node in the next cycle. In such cases that a part of the network is free of nodes and its information are inaccessible, that area can be determined by estimating the consensus between other neighboring nodes. Moreover, the wireless network’s overall coverage is expected to improve by zoning the network area, and using consensus-based estimation and duty cycles.",

IoT devices typically run on batteries because they lack direct access to a power source. Geographical conditions that make it difficult to access the electrical network are a common cause. Finding ways to ensure that IoT devices consume the least amount of energy possible is essential. When the network is experiencing high traffic, locating and interacting with the next hop is critical. Finding the best route to load balance by switching to a less crowded channel is hence crucial in network congestion. Due to the restrictions indicated above, this study analyzes three significant issues—load balancing, energy utilization, and computation cost—and offers a solution. To address these resource allocation issues in the IoT, we suggest a reliable method in this study termed Dynamic Energy-Efficient Load Balancing (DEELB). We conducted several experiments, such as bandwidth analysis, in which the DEELB method used 990.65 kbps of bandwidth for 50 operations, while other existing techniques, such as EEFO (Energy-Efficient Opportunistic), DEERA (Dynamic Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation), ELBS (Efficient Load-Balancing Security), and DEBTS (Delay Energy Balanced Task Scheduling), used 1700.91 kbps, 1500.82 kbps, 1300.65 kbps, and 1200.15 kbps of bandwidth, respectively.

This method produced good performance in terms of accuracy, but because of the implementation of the image processing systems now requires faster process of the computer, the speed of this technique’s process has become an important issue. Approach: A computational approach, called components neighbors-scan labeling algorithm for connected component labeling was presented in this study. This algorithm required scanning through an image only once to label connected components. The algorithm started by scanning from the head of the component’s group, before tracing all the components neighbors by using the main component’s information. This algorithm had desirable characteristics, it is simple while promoted accuracy and low time consuming. By using a table of components, this approach also gave other advantages as the information for the next higher process. Results: The approach had been tested with a collection of binary images.

Perspectives of Gestures for Gestural-Based Interaction Systems: Towards Natural Interaction,https://humanit.hb.se/article/view/512,"Nur Zuraifah Syazrah Othman, Mohd Shafry Mohd Rahim, Masitah Ghazali, Sule Anjomshoae",2019/10/11,Human IT: Journal for Information Technology Studies as a Human Science,,14.0,3,1-25,,"A frequently mentioned benefit of gesture-based input to computing systems is that it provides naturalness in interaction. However, it is not uncommon to find gesture sets consisting of arbitrary (hand) formations with illogically-mapped functions. This defeat the purpose of using gestures as a means to facilitate natural interaction. The root of the issue seems to stem from a separation between what is deemed as gesture in the computing field and what is deemed as gesture linguistically. To find a common ground, this paper explores the fundamental aspects of gestures in the literature of psycho-linguistic-based studies and HCI-based studies. The discussion focuses on the connection between the two perspectives–in the definition aspect through the concept of meaning and context, and in the classification aspect through the mapping of tasks (manipulative or communicative) to gesture functions (ergotic, epistemic or semiotic). By highlighting how these two perspectives interrelate, this paper provides a basis for research works that intend to propose gestures as the interaction modality for interactive systems.",1.0

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a combined non-convex higher order total variation with overlapping group sparse regularizer. The hybrid scheme of both the overlapping group sparse and the non-convex higher order total variation for blocky artifact removal is complementary. The overlapping group sparse term tends to smoothen out blockiness in the restored image more globally, while the non-convex higher order term tends to smoothen parts that are more local to texture while preserving sharp edges.

It is important to have a wide number of intelligent waste management system and several methods to overcome this challenge. This paper explores the application of image processing techniques in recyclable variety type of dry waste.

A Cubic Support Vector Machine (C-SVM) classifier led to promising results with accuracy of training and testing, 83.3% and 81.43%, respectively. The performance of C-SVM classifier is considerably good which provides consistent performance and faster computation time.

In this paper, we first propose a cognitive sensor node (CSN) based game theory for deriving energy via a primary user-transmitted radio frequency signal. Cognitive users' time was segmented into three phases based on a time switching protocol: energy harvest, spectrum sensing and data transmission. The proposed model chooses the optimal energy-harvesting phase as the effected factor. We further propose a distributed energy-harvesting model as a utility function via pricing techniques. The model is a non-cooperative game where players can increase their net benefit in a selfish manner. Here, the price is described as a function pertaining to transmit power, which proves that the proposed energy harvest game includes Nash Equilibrium and is also unique. The best response algorithm is used to achieve the green connection between players. As a result, the results obtained from the proposed model and algorithm show the advantages as well as the effectiveness of the proposed study. Moreover, energy consumption was reduced significantly (12%) compared to the benchmark algorithm because the proposed algorithm succeeded in delivering energy in micro which is much better compared to previous studies. Considering the reduction and improvement in power consumption, we could say the proposed model is suitable for the next wireless environment represented in 5G.",2.0

A single centralized controller is used in a traditional SDN design. However, the complexity of modern networks, due to their size and requirements’ coarseness, has made using a single controller a source of performance bottlenecks. Similarly, the solution found by using multiple controllers in distributed control planes brings forth the profound issue of interoperability, consistency, and the “controller placement problem” (CPP). It is an NP-hard problem that deals with positioning controllers at optimum locations within the network and mapping with resources at the data plane to meet quality of service (QoS) requirements.

Improved seed point placement has been presented with the objectives to generate uniform streamlines placement, to have longer streamlines, and to highlight important regions in the visualization result. These three objectives need to be balanced because there is a trade-off between them. Most of the available seed point placement techniques only focus on one objective and sacrifices the other two.

In order to tackle the problem of large scale pipeline monitoring and unreliable underwater link quality, many algorithms have been proposed and even some of them provided good solutions for these issues but the scalable nodes deployments still need focus and prime attention. In order to handle the problem of nodes deployment, we therefore propose a dynamic nodes deployment algorithm where every node in the network is assigned location in a quick and efficient way without needing any localization scheme. It provides an option to handle the heterogeneous types of nodes, distribute topology and mechanism in which new nodes are easily added to the network without affecting the existing network performance.

An improved weight strategy using one-way ANOVA (F-test) and pathway selection based on the greatest reproducibility power is proposed in eDRW+. The experimental results show that the eDRW+ exceeds other methods in terms of AUC. Besides this, the eDRW+ identifies 294 gene markers and 45 pathway markers from the breast cancer datasets with better AUC. Therefore, the prognostic markers (pathway markers and gene markers) can identify drug targets and look for cancer subtypes with clinically distinct outcomes.",3.0

Microarray technology has widely developed to measure gene expression level changes under normal and experimental conditions. Normally, gene expression data are high dimensional and characterized by small sample sizes. Thus, feature selection is needed to find the smallest number of informative genes and improve the classification accuracy and the biological interpretability results. Due to some feature selection methods neglect the interactions among genes, thus, clustering is used to group the similar genes together. Besides, the quality of the selected data can determine the effectiveness of the classifiers.

Multi-omics data is one of the biological data that exhibits high dimensionality, or more commonly known as the curse of dimensionality. The curse of dimensionality occurs when the dataset contains many features or attributes but with significantly fewer samples or observations. The study focuses on mitigating the curse of dimensionality by implementing Support Vector Machine–Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) as the selected feature selection method in the lung cancer (LUSC) multi-omics dataset integrated from three single omics dataset comprising genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics, and assess the quality of the selected feature subsets using SDAE and VAE deep learning classifiers. In this study, the LUSC datasets first undergo data pre-processing, including checking for missing values, normalization, and removing zero variance features. The cleaned LUSC datasets are then integrated to form a multi-omics dataset. Feature selection was performed on the LUSC multi-omics data using SVM-RFE to select several optimal feature subsets. The five smallest feature subsets (FS) are used in classification using SDAE and VAE neural networks to assess the quality of the feature subsets. The results show that all 5 VAE models can obtain an accuracy and AUC score of 1.000, while only 2 out of 5 SDAE models (FS 1000 & 4000) can do so. 3 out of 5 SDAE models have an AUC score of 0.500, indicating zero capability in separating the binary class labels.

This marker can be used as an indicator to determine a disease outcome, cancer treatment, and drug discovery. Identifying cancer markers is also beneficial to improve cancer patients' survival rate in receiving the treatment decision-making. Cancer markers can be determined by manually testing every gene or pathway in the wet lab or using the text mining automation method. The use of text mining techniques effectively investigates hidden information and gathers new knowledge from many existing sources. Unfortunately, querying relevant text to excavate important information is a challenging task. PubMed text data mining is one of the applications that help explore potential cancer markers as the trend of scientific articles in PubMed is steadily increased. Besides, it can support biologists to concentrate on the identified small set of genes or pathways. PubMed identifiers (PMIDs) are then obtained as evidence to ascertain the relationship between diseases and genes (or pathways) used as biological validation. Thus, this technique can discover the biological relationship between disease and genes or pathways. The existing method is commonly manually curated for the biological validation of genes and pathways. Manual curation takes time in the process and may lead to inconsistency.

Identification of Pathway and Gene Markers Using Enhanced Directed Random Walk for Multiclass Cancer Expression Data,http://eprints.utm.my/id/eprint/98108/1/NiesHuiWenPSC2020.pdf,NIES HUI WEN,2020/6,,,,,,,"Cancer markers play a significant role in the diagnosis of the origin of cancers and in the detection of cancers from initial treatments. This is a challenging task owing to the heterogeneity nature of cancers. Identification of these markers could help in improving the survival rate of cancer patients, in which dedicated treatment can be provided according to the diagnosis or even prevention. Previous investigations show that the use of pathway topology information could help in the detection of cancer markers from gene expression. Such analysis reduces its complexity from thousands of genes to a few hundreds of pathways. However, most of the existing methods group different cancer subtypes into just disease samples, and consider all pathways contribute equally in the analysis process. Meanwhile, the interaction between multiple genes and the genes with missing edges has been ignored in several other methods, and hence could lead to the poor performance of the identification of cancer markers from gene expression. Thus, this research proposes enhanced directed random walk to identify pathway and gene markers for multiclass cancer gene expression data. Firstly, an improved pathway selection with analysis of variances (ANOVA) that enables the consideration of multiple cancer subtypes is performed, and subsequently the integration of k-mean clustering and average silhouette method in the directed random walk that considers the interaction of multiple genes is also conducted.

When people are in close proximity to one another, the virus spreads mostly through the air. It causes some symptoms in the affected person. COVID-19 symptoms are quite variable, ranging from none to severe sickness. As a result, the fuzzy method is seen favourably as a tool for determining the severity of a person’s COVID-19 sickness. However, when applied to a large situation, manually generating a fuzzy parameter is challenging. This could be because of the identification of a large number of fuzzy parameters. A mechanism, such as an automatic procedure, is consequently required to identify the right fuzzy parameters. The metaheuristic algorithm is regarded as a viable strategy. Five meta-heuristic algorithms were analyzed and utilized in this article to classify the severity of COVID-19 sickness data. The performance of the five meta-heuristic algorithms was evaluated using the COVID-19 symptoms dataset. The COVID-19 symptom dataset was created in accordance with WHO and the Indian ministry of health and family welfare criteria.

The identification process in poverty measurement is indeed essential towards acknowledging the poor in the population; hence this needs to be clarified. Malaysia measures poverty by means of poverty line, indicating the unidimensional and inflexible distribution of poor and non-poor especially in urban areas. Many researchers have used fuzzy logic to solve the problem of rigid poor/non-poor dichotomy. This current trend has been able to augment the gap between the rigid and inflexible classification of poor and non-poor. However, there are still several shortcomings that need attention. For instance, the classification of the poor in fuzzy logic that is based on the average income of households still does not cover on the different range of disadvantage on non-monetary items. Based on these trends, ANFIS is proposed to resolve on the highlighted issues. The winning features of ANFIS, which include on simplicity in implementation, understandable explanation facilities through fuzzy rules, and ease of incorporation of both linguistic and numeric knowledge for problem solving may help in producing better result in classification of the urban poor. Essentially, the neural network is proposed to complement the fuzzy system, hence overcoming the limitations of both fuzzy systems and neural networks.

Herb Ontology: Maturity-based Analysis of Lightweight Ontology on Herb Usages,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42909580.pdf,Noor Hidayah Zakaria,2013/10,,,,,,,"Ontology serves as a basis for denominating objects in a certain domain. A lightweight ontology is built using classes, instances and relationships and does not include any axiomatic definitions such as the ones found in heavyweight ontology. However, the lightweight ontology needs to be matured in order to detail the concepts and relationship that occur in a domain. To date, there is no suitable ontology design that exists in the herb domain and a design that is measured due to the heterogeneity of the ontology structures. In this study, a lightweight ontology specializing in herbal domain known as Herb Ontology (HO) is developed to explore the complete use of herbs based on their profiles. It began with the design of an informal domain modelling followed by an informal HO design that would manipulate the Unified Modelling Language (UML) notations to highlight the functionality, services and procedural strategies. In conjunction with that, eleven ontology metrics covering three maturity principles namely: reuse, extend and evolve are presented in this study. The principles are measured in both class-level and ontology-level so that different aspects of the ontology designs can be evaluated and would aid in controlling the development process of HO. Besides that, the HO design was compared with other types of ontology such as COIN, Gene Ontology and OntoCAPE. It was found that HO has Inheritance Richness= 0.99301 with the potential to be reused and a denser network ontology (Edge Node Ratio= 1.84) indicating the possibility of HO being extended and evolved.

Indeed, sentiment analysis has a better effect in movie or product review, survey response, political data science and social media monitoring. Important to realize, a repeated changing objective in disaster management that need to be administer is tend to have higher flexibility in response to shift disaster phases. Due to quick significant change of flood scenario, it is important to have faster improvement process. Thereupon, the practical approach mentioned here can be operationalized by the incorporation of SOA technology. This is due to the simpler service integration because SOA is supported on different platform. By incorporating SOA in flood disaster management framework for sentiment analysis, this approach leads to the reusability. The goal of this work is to review existing flood disaster management, analyzing their incorporation with sentiment analysis and SOA.

The main aim of a CCN caching module is data distribution within the network. Each CCN node can cache content according to its placement policy. Therefore, it is fully equipped to meet the requirements of future networks demands. The placement strategy decides to cache the content at the optimized location and minimize content redundancy within the network. When cache capacity is full, the content eviction policy decides which content should stay in the cache and which content should be evicted. Hence, network performance and cache hit ratio almost equally depend on the content placement and replacement policies. Content eviction policies have diverse requirements due to limited cache capacity, higher request rates, and the rapid change of cache states. Many replacement policies follow the concept of low or high popularity and data freshness for content eviction. However, when content loses its popularity after becoming very popular in a certain period, it remains in the cache space. Moreover, content is evicted from the cache space before it becomes popular. To handle the above-mentioned issue, we introduced the concept of maturity/immaturity of the content. The proposed policy, named Immature Used (IMU), finds the content maturity index by using the content arrival time and its frequency within a specific time frame. Also, it determines the maturity level through a maturity classifier. In the case of a full cache, the least immature content is evicted from the cache space.

The main focus of the CCN caching module is data dissemination within the network. Most of the existing strategies of in-network caching in CCN store the content at the maximum number of routers along the downloading path. Consequently, content redundancy in the network increases significantly, whereas the cache hit ratio and network performance decrease due to the unnecessary utilization of limited cache storage. Moreover, content redundancy adversely affects the cache resources, hit ratio, latency, bandwidth utilization, and server load. We proposed an in-network caching placement strategy named Coupling Parameters to Optimize Content Placement (COCP) to address the content redundancy and associated problems. The novelty of the technique lies in its capability to minimize content redundancy by creating a balanced cache space along the routing path by considering request rate, distance, and available cache space.

Manual image registration is a tedious task and requires more effort, hence developing an automated image registration is very crucial to provide a faster and reliable solution. However, image registration faces many challenges from the nature of remote sensing image, the environment, and the technical shortcoming of the current methods that cause three issues, namely intensive processing power, local intensity variation, and rotational distortion.

Task scheduling is a means by which the tasks or job specified by users are mapped to the resources that execute them. Task scheduling problems in cloud, has been considered as a hard Nondeterministic Polynomial time (Np-hard) optimization problem. Task Scheduling is use to map the task to the available cloud resources like server, CPU memory, storage, and bandwidth for better utilization of resource in cloud. Some of the problems in the task scheduling include load-balancing, low convergence issues, makespan, etc. Convergence in task scheduling signifies a point in the search space that optimize an objective …",5.0

The SOS algorithm (symbiotic organisms search) is a new promising metaheuristic algorithm. It is based on the symbiotic relationship that exists between different species in an ecosystem. Organisms develop symbiotic bonds like mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism to survive in their environment. Standard SOS has since been modified several times, either by hybridization or as better versions of the original algorithm. Most of these modifications came from engineering construction works and other discipline like medicine and finance. However, little improvement on the standard SOS has been noticed on its application in cloud computing environment, especially cloud task scheduling. As a result, this paper provides an overview of SOS applications in task scheduling problem and suggest a new enhanced method for better performance of the technique in terms of fast convergence speed.",2.0

It is meant to optimize applications based on the simulation of the symbiotic relationship among the distinct species in the ecosystem. The task scheduling problem is NP complete, which makes it hard to obtain a correct solution, especially for large-scale tasks. This paper proposes a modified symbiotic organisms search-based scheduling algorithm for the efficient mapping of heterogeneous tasks to access cloud resources of different capacities. The significant contribution of this technique is the simplified representation of the algorithm’s mutualism process, which uses equity as a measure of relationship characteristics or efficiency of species in the current ecosystem to move to the next generation. These relational characteristics are achieved by replacing the original mutual vector, which uses an arithmetic mean to measure the mutual characteristics with a geometric mean that enhances the survival advantage of two distinct species. The modified symbiotic organisms search algorithm (G_SOS) aims to minimize the task execution time (makespan), cost, response time, and degree of imbalance, and improve the convergence speed for an optimal solution in an IaaS cloud. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated using a CloudSim toolkit simulator, and the percentage of improvement of the proposed G_SOS over classical SOS and PSO-SA in terms of makespan minimization ranges between 0.61–20.08% and 1.92–25.68% over a large-scale task …",1.0

Supervisors and lecturers as one of the members of this community rely only on their pervious teaching/supervising background and this is not a good point in this fast growing knowledge sharing era. On the other hand, students who are involved in this program need the specific knowledge to conduct their research with high quality and this knowledge should be prepared for them by program’s head in the well-organized manner. These conditions will limit the quality of this program. Knowing the kind of knowledge and the actual placement of it in this program as well as the method of capturing, using and improvement of it are also crucial issues. In order to gain such kind of understanding, knowledge audit (KA) is the key. This paper presents the results of conducting knowledge audit among this PhD IS community. To capture the knowledge researcher used both interview (for supervisors and lecturers) and questionnaire (for students only). Among 75 active students the questionnaire was distributed only to 50 students and 5 experts lecturers were selected for interview. The results are presented based on the main components of knowledge audit which are knowledge needs, knowledge resources and location and knowledge flow, and also knowledge sharing analysis respectively.

NAHAL-Flex: a numerical and alphabetical hinge detection algorithm for flexible protein structure alignment,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7930520/,"Samira Fotoohifiroozabadi, Mohd Saberi Mohamad, Safaai Deris",2017/5/17,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,,15.0,3,934-943,IEEE,"Flexible proteins are proteins that have conformational changes in their structures. Protein flexibility analysis is critical for classifying and understanding protein functionality. For that analysis, the hinge areas where proteins show flexibility must be detected. To detect the location of the hinges, previous methods have utilized the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins, which is highly computational. To reduce the computational complexity, this study proposes a novel text-based method using structural alphabets (SAs) for detecting the hinge position, called NAHAL-Flex. Protein structures were encoded to a particular type of SA called the protein folding shape code (PFSC), which remains unaffected by location, scale, and rotation. The flexible regions of the proteins are the only places in which letter sequences can be distorted. With this knowledge, it is possible to find the longest alignment path of two letter …",3.0

Although the results were comparable to those obtained via geometrical methods, the SSE length and accuracy of adjacency between SSEs were not considered in the comparison process. Therefore, to obtain further information on accuracy of adjacency between SSE vectors, the new approach of assigning text to vectors was adopted according to the spherical coordinate system in the present study.
