<p> As TikTok continues to grow in popularity, it has become a powerful platform for brands and content creators to reach a large audience. However, with such a vast amount of content available, it can be difficult to know which types of videos will be most engaging and effective for marketing purposes.

In this project, we will develop a system which will beneficial for marketing personnels, content creators or affiliators in engaging with their audience by providing a summary of today's Tiktok trends.</p>
