## Introduction
The Ramen Ratings Dataset is a comprehensive collection of reviews and ratings for various ramen products from around the world. This dataset, available on Kaggle, is a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the diverse world of ramen and understanding the preferences of ramen enthusiasts worldwide. 

Ramen, a traditional Japanese noodle dish, has gained immense popularity globally, with countless brands and flavors available to consumers. This dataset compiles information on numerous ramen products, including their brand, variety, style, country of origin, and detailed reviews from consumers. It offers a wealth of data for researchers, data scientists, and ramen enthusiasts alike to analyze and extract meaningful insights.

## Implementation
### Step 1:
1. Install Xampp, MongoDB and any developer tools such as Visual Studio Code.
2. Configure all tools on your server or local machine.

### Step 2: Create Database Schemas in MySQL
1. Open Xampp and click 'Start' for both Apache and MySQL.
2. Click 'Admin' beside MySQL.

</div>
3. Create new database db_ramen (insert the table by the name tb_user andd follow the attributes below).
<div align="center">
   <img width="500" src="https://github.com/drshahizan/special-topic-data-engineering/assets/120614501/27b373a0-5396-4a33-aadd-89324fbe4600">
</div>
4. Import the database (Follow the instruction below).
On the db_ramen, click "Import"

</div>

Name the table tb_ramen, allow "The first line of the file contains the table column names" and click "Import"
<div align="center">
   <img width="500" src="https://github.com/drshahizan/SECP3843/assets/120614501/cb556490-f136-4a07-8452-73dd5bce1b7e">
</div>

The data will then import inside the database

</div>

### Step 3: Connect to Database
1. ```Mysql```: Create a new PHP file to connect to Mysql.
   ```php
   <?php 
   
    //set db parameters
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $dbname = "db_ramen";

    //create connection
    $con = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    //check connection

    //close connection
   ?>
   ```

2. ```MongoDB```: Create a new PHP file to connect to mongodb.
     ```php
     <?php
     require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Include the MongoDB PHP driver

     // Connect to MongoDB
     $mongoClient = new MongoDB\Client("mongodb://localhost:27017");

     // Select a database
     $db = $mongoClient->selectDatabase('MichelinStar');
     $collection = $db->ramen;
     ?>
     ```

### Step 4: Implement CRUD Operations

CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It refers to the basic operations or actions that can be performed on data in a database or system. These operations are fundamental to managing and manipulating data and are commonly used in software development and database management.

#### Step 4.1: Implement CRUD Operations with MySQL
Develop PHP scripts to perform CRUD operations on the MySQL database:
1. ```Create```: Implement functionality to insert new data records into MySQL.
&nbsp
3. ```Read```: Retrieve and display data from MySQL.
4. ```Update```: Allow for updating existing data records in MySQL.
5. ```Delete```: Provide the ability to remove unwanted data entries from MySQL.

#### Step 4.2: Implement CRUD Operations with MongoDB
Develop PHP scripts to perform CRUD operations on the MongoDB database:
1. ```Create```:: Implement functionality to insert new data records into MongoDB.
2. ```Read```: Retrieve and display data from MongoDB.
3. ```Update```: Allow for updating existing data records in MongoDB.
4. ```Delete```: Provide the ability to remove unwanted data entries from MongoDB.

CRUD operations provide a standardized and comprehensive set of functionalities for managing data in applications and databases. They form the foundation for data manipulation and maintenance, enabling developers to create, retrieve, update, and delete data as needed to ensure data integrity and flexibility in their systems.


### Step 5: Preprocessing and Analysis Data
It has been found that all of the data does not consist of any missing value and we have applied statistical analysis and visualized the data to gain insight into it. 

### Step 6: Develop Web Application
- Utilize PHP to create a user-friendly web interface for the Customer Segmentation System.
- Design an intuitive layout and navigation for easy interaction.
- Implement functionality to display customer data, perform searches, and visualize segmentation results using charts, graphs, or tables.
- Ensure the web interface integrates with both MongoDB and MySQL, supporting CRUD operations for efficient data management.
