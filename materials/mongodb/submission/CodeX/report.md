## Introduction
CodeX Recommendation System is a TV shows recommendation system built using PHP, MySQL, and MongoDB. It leverages the power of these technologies to provide personalized TV show recommendations to users. The system collects user preferences, such as their favorite genres, actors, and previous viewing history, and stores this information in a MySQL database. MongoDB is used for efficient storage and retrieval of TV show data, including details like titles, genres, actors, and ratings.

The recommendation algorithm analyzes the user preferences and compares them with the attributes of various TV shows available in the database. It employs collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate accurate recommendations. PHP acts as the backbone of the system, facilitating seamless communication between the front-end interface and the database. The CodeX Recommendation System provides an intuitive user interface where users can explore recommended TV shows, view ratings to enhance their overall viewing experience.

  <tr>
    <td>u_ic</td>
    <td>Act as a username</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>u_name</td>
    <td>Name of the user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>u_pwd</td>
    <td>Password of the account</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>u_type</td>
    <td>The type of user either admin or normal user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type_id</td>
    <td>The identifier of each user type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type_desc</td>
    <td>The description of each user type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>show_id</td>
    <td>The identifier of each show</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>show_name</td>
    <td>The name of the show</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>rate_id</td>
    <td>The identifier of the rating inserted by the user</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>rate_show_id</td>
    <td>Reflects the show_id of the rated TV Show</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>rate</td>
    <td>Rating from the user of the specific TV Show from scale of 1 to 5 and can enter up to 1 decimal places</td>
  </tr>
</table>
