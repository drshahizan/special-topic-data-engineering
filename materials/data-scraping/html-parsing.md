# HTML Parsing
HTML parsing is a technique used in web scraping to extract data from the HTML code of a webpage. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages, and it consists of a series of tags that define the structure and content of a webpage.

HTML parsing involves analyzing the HTML code of a webpage and identifying specific tags and attributes that contain the data of interest. This is usually done using an HTML parser library, such as Beautiful Soup, lxml, or HTML Parser.

Here's how HTML parsing typically works:

1. Retrieve the HTML code of the webpage using a library like Requests.

2. Parse the HTML code using an HTML parser library, such as Beautiful Soup.

3. Identify the specific tags and attributes that contain the data of interest, such as the class or id attributes.

4. Extract the data from the identified tags and attributes using the parsing library.

5. Save the extracted data in a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file.

HTML parsing is a useful technique for web scraping because it allows for the extraction of structured data from unstructured HTML code. This data can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as research, analysis, and decision-making.
