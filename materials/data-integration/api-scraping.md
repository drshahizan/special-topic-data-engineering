# API Scraping
API (Application Programming Interface) scraping is a technique used in web scraping to extract data from websites that provide APIs for accessing their data. APIs allow developers to access data in a structured format, such as JSON or XML, making it easier to extract and use the data.

API scraping typically involves making requests to the API endpoints provided by the website and retrieving the desired data. Here's how API scraping typically works:

1. Obtain an API key or authorization to access the API.

2. Identify the API endpoint that contains the data of interest.

3. Make a request to the API endpoint using a library like Requests and passing in any necessary parameters, such as search queries or filters.

4. Retrieve the response from the API, which will typically be in a structured format like JSON or XML.

5. Parse the response data using a parsing library like JSON or XML to extract the data of interest.

6. Save the extracted data in a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file.

API scraping is a powerful technique for web scraping because it allows for the extraction of structured data directly from the source, without having to parse through unstructured HTML code. However, it's important to note that websites may have limits or restrictions on their APIs, and scraping APIs without permission or in violation of terms of service can lead to legal or ethical issues.
