This folder provides a concise demonstration of data integration using Azure Data Factory from DataSphere. It showcases the process of combining three datasets, each containing 5 users, into a unified table in an Azure SQL Database. The datasets are stored in different formats (CSV and XLSX) and are connected using Blob Storage and Linked Services. This folder includes the datasets, a report detailing the steps taken, and a JSON file for the Azure Data Factory pipeline configuration. By following the instructions provided, users can gain insights into data integration techniques with Azure Data Factory and replicate the process in their own Azure environment.
