## Introduction📚

In this assignment, the Student Result Analysis System allows users to perform various tasks such as create examination, manage users, manage examination questions and view examination results. All the data created will be stored into both databases, MongoDB and phpmyadmin. Both of these databases can associate with the systemm to ensure the accuracy of the data. Throughtout the process, we discover the method on how to connect php to local MongoDB database along with the phpmyadmin, so that the data will always be updated when there are data changes in the system. With all the tools, all the users can easily navigate to our system and the data can be stored in a secure place.
