## 📄 Executive Summary

From year to year, the more and more disease have been discovered and spread across the world. Some of the diseases are non-communicable causes by bad habits from new generation. The amount of patient suffereing from the disease have been increasing drastically but due to financial status most of them not able to affort expensive healthcare treatment. Early detection and prevention are crucial to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.

Therefore, this proposal outlines the development of a heart disease prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model will analyze patient data to predict the likelihood of developing heart disease and will enable healthcare providers to take proactive measures to prevent the disease. By leveraging predictive analytics, healthcare organizations can anticipate patient needs, prevent adverse events, and optimize resource utilization, resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced cost.


## 🌎 Background

Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Heart disease is caused by various factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and a sedentary lifestyle.

Detecting heart disease early is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing the risk of complications such as heart attack and stroke. Traditional risk assessment tools such as the Framingham Risk Score and the ASCVD risk estimator use patient data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status to estimate the risk of developing heart disease. However, these tools have limited accuracy, and many patients with heart disease are not identified until they experience symptoms.

Machine learning techniques offer a promising approach to predicting heart disease risk by analyzing patient data to identify patterns and relationships. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, it is possible to develop predictive models that can accurately identify patients at risk of developing heart disease.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning for heart disease prediction. Researchers have developed various machine learning models to predict heart disease risk using patient data such as electronic health records, medical imaging, and genetic data. These models have shown promising results, outperforming traditional risk assessment tools and improving patient outcomes.

Therefore, the proposed heart disease prediction using machine learning project aims to develop an accurate prediction model that can enable healthcare providers to identify patients at risk of developing heart disease, take proactive measures to prevent the disease, and improve patient outcomes.

## 🎯 Goals and Objectives

The goal of the heart disease prediction platform is to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimize resource utilization through predictive analytics. To achieve this goal, the platform will have the following objectives:

- To collect and preprocess patient data such as medical history, demographics, lab results, and other relevant variables.
- Develop predictive models using advanced analytics techniques.
- To develop a user-friendly web-based interface for healthcare providers to input patient data and obtain heart disease risk predictions.
- To identify the most important predictors of heart disease risk using feature selection techniques.
- Monitor and evaluate platform performance to continuously improve outcomes.

Overall, the goals and objectives of this proposal are aimed at developing a reliable and accurate machine learning-based heart disease prediction system. The platform will enable healthcare providers to make informed decisions about patient care and resource allocation and will help healthcare organizations to achieve their strategic goals.
