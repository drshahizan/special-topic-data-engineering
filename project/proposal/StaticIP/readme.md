## Introduction 📒 
  Energy usage analysis is a technique for quantitatively analyzing energy use in order to better understand and manage energy use. This research can focus on any kind of energy, including power, natural gas, gasoline, coal, and others.

  Data on energy usage can be gathered and analyzed using a variety of tools and methods in energy consumption analysis. These instruments include data loggers, energy meters, and energy tracking devices, among others. Businesses and organizations can use these tools and techniques to spot possible energy waste, minimize energy waste and expenses, and take the necessary actions to increase energy efficiency.

  Energy usage research is crucial for developing and implementing energy reduction strategies. It can help businesses and organizations identify which operations use the most energy, which equipment uses the most energy, and which energy-saving measures are most effective. This knowledge can be used to set goals, develop energy-saving strategies, and take the required steps in order to decrease energy loss and costs while increasing energy efficiency.
