## 1. Executive Summary
Netflix, YouTube, Spotify and many more streaming platforms have been introduced to the world as the technologies are advancing rapidly nowadays. With this being said, users are prone to use it almost everyday whenever they wanted to watch movies or tv shows and stream any music. In this project, our group will focused on the collaborative filtering recommendation engine, which is implemented by the website that we used. The objective of this project is to create a system (dashboard) that display the best suggestion of movies on based on the users preference. The system we proposed will use a database that can keep track on the user behavioral data which will then be processed using prediction to recognize streaming patterns of each user so that the most relevant suggestion can be presented to the users to increase the users satisfactory.


## 2. Background
This website is a global streaming service that provides a vast selection of movies and documentaries. One of the key features that set this website apart from other streaming services is its personalized recommendation system, which uses data science and machine learning algorithms to provide personalized content recommendations to its users. The website's recommendation system is based on a complex algorithm that takes into account a wide range of factors, especially user rating. The system continuously learns from the user's behavior and adjusts the recommendations to provide more relevant content over time.

The recommendation system has been a critical factor of success of this company and has helped to attract new users. As a result, the development and improvement of the recommendation system have been a key focus for the website's data science and engineering teams.
As a result of its success, the recommendation system has become a benchmark for personalized recommendation systems across various industries, and its algorithms and techniques have been adopted by other companies, such as Amazon, Spotify, and YouTube.

## 3. Goals and Objective
1) Implement the usage of MongoDB to create recommendation engine
2) Be able to understand steps of using MongoDB to create recommendation engine, which are Data Collection , Data Cleaning, Data Transformation , Data Loading , Model Training and Recommedation Generation based on study case
3) Improve the user experience: One of the primary goals of a data-driven project may be to improve the user experience. For example, for most recommendation system, the goal may be to provide personalized and relevant content recommendations to improve user satisfaction and engagement.
4) Enhance data quality: A key objective of a data-driven project may be to enhance data quality. This includes ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and consistency to improve the reliability and usefulness of the data for analysis and modeling.
5) Develop predictive models: Another objective may be to develop predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes.
6) Ensure data security: One of the critical objectives of a data-driven project may be to ensure data security. This includes implementing appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats.
7) Improve operational efficiency: A data-driven project may aim to improve operational efficiency by automating tasks, reducing manual intervention, and streamlining processes.

## 4. Scope
- The scope of this project is to recreate the website's recommedation engine based on few factors. These factors will create personalized recommendation.
- This project requires dataset scraped from the website using Python.
- The main tool will be used in this project is MongoDB to store user ratings metadata content in this website.
- - This project use Python language to do the unsupervised machine learning for the prediction of clusters.
- Tableau will be used to create visualizations of the recommendation system's performance.


## 5. Methodology
| Components | Description |
|--|--|
| Data Collection | Collect data from the website using API. This data will be used to train the recomendation model  |
| Data Cleaning | Clean the collected data to removed irrelevant data, unwanted characters and incomplete data such as null in user watching video period. |
| Data Transforming | Transform the cleaned data used by MongoDB |
| Data Loading | Load transformed data into MongoDB collections |
| Model Training | Trains the recommendation model using unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on data collected in steps 1 |
| Recomendation Generator | Generate recommendations for users based on their previous interaction with the system |


## 6. System Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:

| No. | Components | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Data Collection| We will collect the Spotify data from Kaggle, the data contains about music title and the Top200 chart. The data will collected in csv file.|
| 2. | Data Storage | The data collected will be stored in MongoDB. |
| 3. | Data preprocessing | We will clean and preprocess the data before evaluating it. To normalize the text data, we will remove stop words, punctuation, and URLs, as well as perform stemming and lemmatization. Not only that, we also planed to change the data format from JSON to CSV, so the data is easier to execute.|
| 4. | Data analysis and modeling | The preprocessed data will be analysis using **k-means algorithm** |
| 5. | Model deployment |**PHP**, a php web framework, will be used by the model deployment component to deploy machine learning models to a web server. The algorithm will deploy the trained data after machine learning. This will help a lot to see the end result and also for data visulization |
| 6. | Visualization and reporting | We will use **Tableau** to create reports and dashboards that can be shared with stakeholders. |

## 7. Risks and Limitation
Spotify Personalized system has been widely praised for its ability to personalize recommendations to individual users based on their ratings. However, here are some potential risks and limitations associated with this website's recommendation system, along with potential strategies to mitigate them:
1. Technical Risk
- `Cold Start Problem:` When a new user signs up for the website, the recommendation algorithm has no data about their ratings of any movie, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. This "cold start" problem can be challenging to overcome and may require alternative approaches to recommendation.

Potential Strategies to Mitigate the Risks & Limitation:

1. Technical Risk
- `Cold Start Problem:` To address the cold start problem, the website can use hybrid recommendation approaches that combine collaborative filtering (based on user behavior) with content-based filtering (based on content metadata). This can help to provide relevant recommendations to new users even when they have no viewing history.

Overall, while movies recommendation system is generally effective, it is important to recognize its limitations and potential risks, and to be mindful of how the algorithm is shaping our viewing habits and preferences.

Quality Assurance and Testing Procedures

1. Quality Assurance
  - Validate the data used by the recommendation system. The data should be accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to the user.
  - Collect feedback from users. The system can ask the users to rate the recommendations they receive and use the feedback to enhance the system.
2. Testing Procedures
  - Functional testing verifying that the system is working as intended that includes the system's ability to produce recommendations based on user history, preference and ratings.
  - Performance testing verifying that the system able to handle a high volume of requests and provide recommendations in a timely manner.
  - User Acceptance testing is to test the system with the actual users to verify that the system is providing relevant recommendations that meet their needs.

## 12. Conclusion
In conclusion, the proposed system will provide shows/movies reccomendation based on user's favourite genre, director, actors, and many more. Users will be able to create content-based filtering to provide personalised reccomendation. However, the recommendation system is not perfect, and there have been cases where users have reported getting irrelevant or inappropriate recommendations. This can be due to various factors, such as limited data or biases in the algorithm. While there is still room for improvement, the system will be a game-changer in the entertainment industry and will help to shape the way we consume media today.
