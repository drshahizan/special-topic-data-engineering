<h1 align='center'>Spotify Engine Reccomendation</h1>
The project consists of a PHP-based Spotify recommendation engine that offers individualised Spotify suggestions based on Title and Genres. This smart system analyses user data and produces precise music recommendations using cutting-edge algorithms and machine learning approaches. By offering consumers a personalised selection of films that suit their preferences, CompassDB seeks to improve the movie-watching experience. With its user-friendly dashboard, which is powered by Tableau, customers may learn a lot about their musical preferences and decide on their next song with confidence.
