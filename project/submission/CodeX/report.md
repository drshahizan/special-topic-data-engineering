## Introduction
A movie recommendation engine is a software system designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences, past viewing history, and other relevant factors. It uses advanced algorithms and techniques to analyze large datasets containing information about movies, such as genres, directors, actors, and user ratings. By leveraging this data, the recommendation engine can generate accurate and relevant movie recommendations for individual users.

Movie recommendation engines often incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to continuously improve their accuracy and relevance. As users provide feedback on the recommended movies, the system learns from this feedback and refines its recommendations over time, adapting to the changing preferences of the user.

Overall, a movie recommendation engine aims to enhance the user's movie-watching experience by providing personalized and relevant movie suggestions, saving them time and effort in finding movies that align with their tastes.

## Background
The development of movie recommendation engines can be traced back to the early days of collaborative filtering techniques in the late 1990s. Collaborative filtering is a method that analyzes user behavior and preferences to make predictions or recommendations. Initially, movie recommendation systems relied heavily on collaborative filtering, where they would compare a user's preferences with those of other users to generate recommendations.

Over time, advancements in technology and the availability of large-scale movie databases led to the incorporation of additional techniques and algorithms in recommendation engines. Content-based filtering emerged as another approach, where movies are analyzed based on their attributes such as genre, director, actors, and plot summaries. By matching these attributes with a user's preferences, content-based filtering can generate recommendations.

## Objectives
- To give reccomendation personalisation to each user 
- Introduce users to new movie
- To create a dashboard using business intelligence softwares to enhance users interaction with system

## Scope
The movie recommendation engine collects relevant data about movies, such as genre, director, actors, release year, ratings, and user reviews. This data is obtained from movie databases, APIs, and user-generated platforms. Advanced algorithms, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, are used to process the collected data and generate personalized movie recommendations for users. The recommendation engine can be integrated with external platforms, such as streaming services or ticket booking websites, to provide a seamless user experience. A user-friendly dashboard or interface is developed to enhance user interaction, allowing users to manage their profiles, view recommended movies, provide feedback, and access additional movie-related information. Integration with business intelligence software enables deeper analysis of user preferences and viewing patterns, improving the effectiveness of recommendations.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Scrap data from IMDB using APIs and python
2. Data Pre-Processing: Implement Alteryx to clean and prepare data
3. Data Visualisation: Used Tableau to visualise and create dashboards

## Insight
By leveraging the power of data collection and advanced algorithms, a movie recommendation engine can provide users with personalized movie suggestions that align with their unique preferences. The integration of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques allows the engine to consider both user behavior and movie attributes, resulting in accurate and relevant recommendations. The seamless integration with external platforms enhances the user experience by providing direct links to watch movies, check showtimes, or purchase tickets. With a user-friendly dashboard and interface, users can effortlessly explore recommended movies, manage their profiles, and provide valuable feedback. Furthermore, by integrating with business intelligence software, the recommendation engine gains the ability to analyze user preferences and viewing patterns, leading to continuous improvement in recommendation quality and overall user satisfaction.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, a movie recommendation engine serves as a powerful tool to enhance the movie-watching experience for users. By collecting and analyzing data about movies and user preferences, the engine generates personalized recommendations that align with individual tastes. The integration of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms ensures accurate and relevant suggestions. Seamless integration with external platforms enables easy access to movies, showtimes, and ticket booking. The user-friendly dashboard and interface further enhance user interaction and engagement. By leveraging business intelligence software, the recommendation engine continuously improves its performance by analyzing user behavior and refining its recommendations. Overall, a well-designed movie recommendation engine offers a tailored and convenient movie discovery experience, saving users time and effort in finding movies that match their interests
