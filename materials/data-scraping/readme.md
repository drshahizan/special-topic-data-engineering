## Assignment

This assignment is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Web scraping multimedia content
You must select the appropriate website to do web scraping multimedia content. For example, you can use the [Flickr.com](flickr.md) website. Flickr is a popular photo-sharing platform that contains a vast collection of images and videos that can be scraped for data analysis purposes. Here is a suggested outline for the assignment:

#### 1. Introduction

Briefly introduce the topic of web scraping multimedia content and the importance of this type of data for research and analysis.

#### 2. Web Scraping Flickr

- Explain why Flickr is a good source for multimedia content and provide a brief overview of the site.
- Detail the web scraping process, including the tools and libraries used and any challenges that were encountered.
- Discuss the data set obtained, including metadata such as data size, file type, and other relevant information.

#### 3. Choosing a Library for Web Scraping

- Compare and contrast the available libraries for web scraping multimedia content, including Pillow and OpenCV.
- Explain the criteria used to choose the appropriate library for this project.
- Justify the final choice and explain the advantages of the chosen library.

#### 4. Storing Data in MongoDB

- Discuss the benefits of using MongoDB for storing multimedia content data.
- Explain the best way to store the data in MongoDB, including the data structure and organization.
- Provide examples of how the data can be queried and analyzed using MongoDB.

#### 5. Conclusion

- Summarize the main points of the assignment and restate the importance of web scraping multimedia content for data analysis.
- Offer suggestions for future research or analysis using the data set obtained from Flickr.

### Part 2: Web scraping text content
You need to find a website relevant to data publication content, such as the [Google Scholar](google-scholar.md) website. Google Scholar is a popular search engine for academic publications, making it an excellent source for web scraping data related to the Faculty of Computing at the University of Technology Malaysia. Here is a suggested outline for the assignment:

#### 1. Introduction
- Briefly introduce the topic of web scraping publication content and the importance of this type of data for research and analysis.

#### 2. Web Scraping Google Scholar
- Explain why Google Scholar is a good source for publication content and provide a brief overview of the site.
- Detail the web scraping process, including the tools and libraries used and any challenges that were encountered.
- Discuss the data set obtained, including metadata such as data size, file type, and other relevant information.

#### 3. Choosing a Library for Web Scraping
- Compare and contrast the available libraries for web scraping publication content, including Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
- Explain the criteria used to choose the appropriate library for this project.
- Justify the final choice and explain the advantages of the chosen library.

#### 4. Storing Data in MongoDB
- Discuss the benefits of using MongoDB for storing publication content data.
- Explain the best way to store the data in MongoDB, including the data structure and organization.
- Provide examples of how the data can be queried and analyzed using MongoDB.

#### 5. Conclusion
- Summarize the main points of the assignment and restate the importance of web scraping publication content for data analysis.
- Offer suggestions for future research or analysis using the data set obtained from Google Scholar.

Overall, this write-up should demonstrate a thorough understanding of the process of web scraping publication content, as well as the tools and libraries used for this task. It should also provide a clear and detailed explanation of how the data is stored and organized in MongoDB for efficient querying and analysis.

### Others
- Collaborate effectively with your group members to complete the task.
- Ensure to send the report in **mark down** format and **source code**.
- Please submit the assignments in the submission [**Part 1**](https://github.com/drshahizan/special-topic-data-engineering/tree/main/assignment/data-scraping/submission/part1) and [**Part 2**](https://github.com/drshahizan/special-topic-data-engineering/tree/main/assignment/data-scraping/submission/part2) folder.
