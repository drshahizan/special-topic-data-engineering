</p>

Data scraping, also known as `web scraping`, is a technique of `extracting data from websites` using automated software programs. It involves writing code that sends automated requests to a website, parses the HTML or XML content, and extracts the desired information. In simple terms, data scraping is the process of `collecting information` from the internet and transforming it into structured data that can be used for various purposes such as analysis, research, or business intelligence.

Data scraping tools are commonly used for this purpose, as they can automate the process and provide a range of features and capabilities to extract data from different types of web pages, handle complex data structures, and schedule and automate scraping tasks. However, it is important to note that data scraping must be done in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and with respect for the privacy of individuals. Overall, data scraping is a useful technique that can help businesses and researchers collect and analyze large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.


## Why is Data Scraping important?

</p>

Data Scraping provides businesses, researchers, and individuals with a powerful tool to `collect and analyze large amounts of data` quickly and efficiently. By `automating repetitive tasks`, data scraping can help businesses save time and money, while also providing valuable insights that can improve decision-making.

1. `Business intelligence` : Data scraping can help businesses gather valuable information about competitors, customers, and market trends. This information can be used to develop new products and services, optimize marketing strategies, and improve business operations.

2. `Research` : Data scraping can be used in academic research to collect large amounts of data for analysis. This can help researchers identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can be used to draw meaningful conclusions.

3. `Automation` : Data scraping can automate repetitive tasks, such as gathering data from websites, which can save time and reduce the risk of errors. This can be especially useful in industries that rely on large amounts of data, such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.

4. `Price monitoring` : Data scraping can be used to monitor prices of products and services in real-time. This can help businesses adjust their prices to remain competitive, and also provide consumers with up-to-date pricing information.

5. `Job market analysis` : Data scraping can be used to collect job postings from various sources, such as job boards and company websites. This information can be used to analyze job market trends, identify skill gaps, and provide insights to job seekers.

   <td>
    To prevent malicious activity from accessing their web data, websites use a variety of anti-scraping strategies.

To reduce the risk of being discovered, companies using proxy servers must constantly change their IP addresses for each new connection request. Canopy eventually exhausted all of the IP addresses provided by the proxy server's IP pool and encountered the same problem.
