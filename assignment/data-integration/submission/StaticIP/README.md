## Introduction📚
<img src="https://www.mentromax.com/img/Azure-Data-Factory-Logo.png">
When we talk about big data and data analysis, we always start form raw unorganized data. This kind of data is often stored in relational, non-realtional and other storage systems. The main problem about it is that it does not provide any useful and meaningful information to us. To solve this problem, a service that can refine and organize the raw data into useful business insights is needed. One of the well-known platform that provides this service is Azure Data Factory. It is a managed cloud service that specialized in handling extract-transform-load (ETL), extract-load-transform (ELT), and data integration projects.
