### Data Requirements

  The data requirements for the systems are as follows:
  <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ID</td>
    <td>A unique identifier for each customer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gender</td>
    <td>The customer's gender either male or female</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Age</td>
    <td>The customer's age</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Annual Income</td>
    <td>The total amount of money ($) the customer's earn in one year</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spending Score</td>
    <td>The score (out of 100) given to a customer, based on the money spent and the behavior of the customer</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Profession</td>
    <td>The customer's occupation field</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Work Experience</td>
    <td>The total number of work that the customer has done before</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Functionalities

The Customer Analysis System provide the following functionalities:
- Data Analysis: The system employs data science techniques like statistical analysis to analyze customer data and extract valuable insights.

- Data Visualization: The system provide visual representations of the analyzed data to facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Charts, graphs, and dashboards can be used to display key metrics, trends, and patterns.

- CRUD Operations: The system allows for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage customer data efficiently. This includes inserting new customer records, retrieving and displaying customer information, updating customer details, and deleting unwanted data entries.

- Search Functionality: The system support search capabilities to enable users to find specific customer.

## Implementation
### Step 1: Set Up Development Environment
1. Before starting to implement the system, make sure to install all required software.
  - [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
  - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
2. Configure MongoDB on your server or local machine. Make sure the MongoDB server is running and accessible.
3. Direct to your project directory and running the following command to install MongoDB PHP driver.
   ```
   composer require mongodb/mongodb
   ```
### Step 2: Create Database Schemas in MySQL
1. Create a database and table in mysql to store customer data.

### Step 3: Connect to Database
1. ```Mysql```: Create a new PHP file to connect to Mysql.
   ```php
    <?php
    //Set db parameters
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $dbname = "customer";

    //Create connection
    $con = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
    ?>
    ```

2. ```MongoDB```: Create a new PHP file to connect to mongodb.
     ```php
     <?php
     require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Include the MongoDB PHP driver

     // Connect to MongoDB
     $mongoClient = new MongoDB\Client("mongodb://localhost:27017");

     // Select a database
     $database = $mongoClient->selectDatabase('your_database_name');
     ?>
     ```

   Replace `'your_database_name'` with the actual name of your MongoDB database.
   
### Step 4: Implement CRUD Operations with MySQL
Develop PHP scripts to perform CRUD operations on the MySQL database:
1. ```Create```: Implement functionality to insert new data records into MySQL.
2. ```Read```: Retrieve and display data from MySQL.
3. ```Update```: Allow for updating existing data records in MySQL.
4. ```Delete```: Provide the ability to remove unwanted data entries from MySQL.

### Step 5: Implement CRUD Operations with MongoDB
Develop PHP scripts to perform CRUD operations on the MongoDB database:
1. ```Create```:: Implement functionality to insert new data records into MongoDB.
2. ```Read```: Retrieve and display data from MongoDB.
3. ```Update```: Allow for updating existing data records in MongoDB.
4. ```Delete```: Provide the ability to remove unwanted data entries from MongoDB.

### Step 6: Preprocessing and Analysis Data
It has been found that all of the data does not consist of any missing value and we have applied statistical analysis and visualized the data to gain insight into it. 

### Step 7: Develop Web Application
- Utilize PHP to create a user-friendly web interface for the Customer Segmentation System.
- Design an intuitive layout and navigation for easy interaction.
- Implement functionality to display customer data, perform searches, and visualize segmentation results using charts, graphs, or tables.
- Ensure the web interface integrates with both MongoDB and MySQL, supporting CRUD operations for efficient data management.
