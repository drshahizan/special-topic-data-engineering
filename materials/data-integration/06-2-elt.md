# Extract, Load, Transform (ELT)

ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform, and it refers to a process used in data warehousing and business intelligence to move data from various sources into a centralized data store, such as a data warehouse, for analysis and reporting. 

Here is a more detailed description of each of the ELT steps:

1. Extract: Data is extracted from various sources, such as databases, web APIs, or flat files, into a centralized data repository, such as a data lake, which is typically a raw storage area where the data is held until it is transformed and loaded into the target system. Extracted data can be filtered to select only the relevant data or to eliminate data that is not required.

2. Load: Data is loaded into the target system, such as a data warehouse, without any significant transformation. The raw data is stored in its original format, and the schema is typically applied at the time of analysis or reporting. This step is often referred to as a "staging" or "landing" area, where data can be stored temporarily until it is transformed for analysis.

3. Transform: Data is transformed or manipulated in various ways to meet the specific requirements of the analysis or reporting. This involves cleaning the data, converting data types, aggregating data, and deriving new fields or metrics. Transformation can be performed using a variety of tools and techniques, such as SQL, Python, or visual data preparation tools.

ELT is often used in situations where the volume and complexity of the data make it difficult to transform the data before loading it into the target system. By loading the raw data into a centralized repository, analysts and data scientists can access and transform the data as needed for their specific use cases. ELT can also reduce the time and cost associated with transforming data, as the transformation step can be deferred until it is needed for analysis or reporting.
