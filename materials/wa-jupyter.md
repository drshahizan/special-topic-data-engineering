# Jupyter Notebook: How to use it to create a web application using Django and MongoDb

Jupyter Notebook is **not the recommended tool** to develop a web application using MongoDB and Django. It is primarily designed for interactive data science and visualization, and it lacks the necessary features and capabilities for web application development.

Instead, you can use a combination of Django and MongoDB to develop your web application, and Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze your data. To use Django and MongoDB together, you can follow the steps outlined in my previous response.

However, if you still want to use Jupyter Notebook to develop your web application, you can use the Jupyter Notebook to write and test your Python code, including the Django and MongoDB code, and then copy and paste the relevant code into your Django project files.

To use Jupyter Notebook with Django and MongoDB, you need to install the necessary Python packages, including Django, djongo, and pymongo, which you can install using the pip package manager.

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can start a new Jupyter Notebook and import the required packages, create and manipulate MongoDB databases and collections using pymongo, and define your Django models using djongo. You can then use the Notebook to test your code and refine your approach before copying and pasting it into your Django project files.

Keep in mind that using Jupyter Notebook for web application development can be cumbersome, error-prone, and difficult to maintain, so it is generally not recommended. It is best to use a dedicated IDE or editor like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text for developing Django web applications.
