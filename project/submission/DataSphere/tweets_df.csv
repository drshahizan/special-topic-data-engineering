1230,onaccel,2023-06-16 22:30:10+00:00,0,,"Psychiatry of China in reference to politics

The field of psychiatry examines mental health and psychological well-being, and it is not appropriate to diagnose or analyze the mental health of an entire country or its political system. However, we can discuss the intersection of psychiatry and politics in the context of China.

In China, as in any country, mental health is an important aspect of public health. The Chinese government has recognized the significance of mental health issues and has made efforts to address them. In recent years, there has been increased awareness about mental health concerns in China, and the government has taken steps to improve mental health services and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.

However, it is also worth noting that the Chinese government has been criticized for its human rights record, including concerns related to political repression and restrictions on freedom of expression. These issues can have an impact on the mental well-being of individuals and contribute to psychological distress.

China has a history of using psychiatric diagnoses and treatments for political purposes. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), psychiatric institutions were used to detain and ""treat"" individuals who were deemed to be counter-revolutionaries or enemies of the state. This led to the abuse and mistreatment of many individuals, as psychiatric diagnoses were often politically motivated.

In recent years, there have been reports of the Chinese government using psychiatry to suppress dissent and silence critics. For example, there have been allegations of psychiatric detention and forced medication of political dissidents and human rights activists. These practices have drawn international scrutiny and criticism from human rights organizations.

It is important to recognize that the intersection of psychiatry and politics can be complex, and it is essential to uphold ethical principles and respect human rights in the practice of psychiatry. International organizations and mental health professionals play a crucial role in monitoring and advocating for the protection of human rights and promoting ethical standards in the field of psychiatry, regardless of the political context.

Reading & writing is still taught with flawed programs. Topics are being added that go against the belief systems of many families. In IL, schools started treating mental health w/out informing parents. 

It feels like a betrayal against parents & teachers when the last few years were already so very challenging.

All most want is for school to be a place where kids can learn foundational skills, build a knowledge base, & practice how to work well with peers and teachers. Where they can learn to respect the beliefs and choices of others while feeling **like it‚Äôs OK to have their own.**

That requires a positive relationship WITH families- not an adversarial one.

No one wants school be a place where families feel unwelcome &/or helpless to get their kids the help they need- Where they can‚Äôt trust that they will know what is happening with their kids at school.

Right? 

I‚Äôd like to work towards something better."

2. Active Listening. Listen with the intent to understand, not just to hear them. Listen without judgment. Stay present and let go of trying to ""fix it."" 

3. Ask them what they need or how you can support them? They may need you to listen, or they may be looking for advice. Ask them.

4. Be an example. Take care of your mental health, set your boundaries, learn healthy coping mechanism that works for you, and learn more about mental health
