## üß≠ Executive Summary
The TikTok Trends Dashboard project aims to provide valuable insights into the latest trends on the popular social media platform TikTok. The project's primary goal is to create a dashboard that will display the ranking of TikTok's trending videos based on the number of likes, comments, shares, and plays.

The dashboard will be a powerful tool for marketing teams, content creators, and affiliates who are looking to engage with their audience on TikTok. By understanding what types of content are currently trending on the platform, they can create content that resonates with their audience and drives engagement and growth.

## üå± Background:

TikTok is a fast-growing social media platform that has become increasingly popular for marketing purposes. However,  with over 1 billion monthly active users (2021) on the platform, it can be difficult to stand out and generate engagement. As of now, there is no effective solution for users or businesses to analyze and understand TikTok trends and insights. This makes it difficult for businesses or individuals to understand what is popular on TikTok and create content that resonates with their target audience.

The proposed solution is to develop a TikTok Insights Dashboard, which is an analysis tool that utilizes web scraping to collect data from TikTok's website or API and store it in a database, MongoDB. The TikTok Insights Dashboard would contain analytics and insights on what is trending on the TikTok platform such as information on popular songs, hashtags, and challenges.

By utilizing the dashboard, businesses and individuals can gain valuable insights into the content that is currently trending and tailor their content to match the latest trends. This can help them increase their engagement on the platform and reach a wider audience.


## üèÖ Goals and Objectives:
TikTok Insights Dashboard's primary goal is to provide TikTok creators with a complete picture of their account's performance and audience engagement. This is accomplished through the use of numerous metrics and data points that can assist creators in making informed decisions about their content strategy and understanding how their audience reacts to their material. With the help of informations from TikTok Insights Dashboard content creators, affiliates and marketing team can improvise their content to achieve their target audience and sales. In addition they also can optimize their content strategy, better engage with their audience, and grow their following on the platform. On top of that,

The TikTok insights dashboard project aims to solve these problem statements: 

- i. Limited visibility into performance -
It is tough for creators to tell how their work is performing on TikTok without analytics tools. They may know how many views their videos have, but they may not know how long users are watching them, what their engagement rate is, or how their content affects their following growth.

- ii. Difficulty detecting trends -
TikTok is a fast-paced platform, and keeping up with hot subjects and hashtags can be tough. Creators may miss out on opportunities to develop content that resonates with their audience and capitalises on popular trends if they do not use analytics tools.

- iii. Inability to measure success - 
Without analytics tools, content creators may be unaware of how successful their content is or what modifications they can make to increase interaction. This can lead to a loss of motivation and dissatisfaction for content creators who are attempting to grow their following and develop effective material.

- iv. Quality and completeness of data - 
To ensure the effectiveness of this system, the data must be accurate and complete. Data quality issues needs to be focused to made sure the system is reliable.

- v. Inadequate grasp of audience demographics -
Without data on their audience, creators may not know who is responding to their content or what changes they can make to better target their ideal audience. This can make it tough for them to develop material that will engage and grow their audience.

## üîç Scope: 
<!-- The objective of this system is to provide current TikTok trends by analyzing a large amount of data which will enable users to gain insight for effective decision-making and analysis. Below contains the project scope statement which will help us achieve said objective. -->

![scope](projectscope.jpg)

- i. Data Source : The raw data will be scraped from TikTok through an [API](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api).

- ii. Database Development : The data will be stored into MongoDB database. 

- iii. Data Cleaning : The dataset will be cleaned and prepared by using Python library such as Pandas and Numpy.

- iv. Data Preparation: Data pre-processing will be done by using Python and the data will be visualised in a form of a dashboard by using Streamlit.

- v. Website design : Streamlit will be used to build and design the framework of the website.

- vi. Website testing : The website will be tested multiple times to detect any issues before making them live.

- vii. Project monitoring and documentation : The project will continuously be monitored and documented to keep track of the progress of project and to optimize the website performance.


## üìñ Methodology:
This project will be using various research methods to achieve our main objective which is to build a system to display TikTok trends. The table below presents the specified procedures, strategies, technologies and softwares used in this project. 

| Components | Description |
|--|--|
| Data Collection |  Installing TikTok API, Setup VS Code, Getting Data from TikTok|
| Data Storage |  Export data to MongoDB database in JSON format|
| Data Pre-processing | Data is processed in MongoDB, Data will be cleaned, filtered and transformed more into a usable format by using Python library such as Numpy and Pandas. [Example of TikTok preprocessed data](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/TikTok_Analytics/blob/master/data/preprocessed/tiktokdata.csv)|
| Feature Engineering | Only relevant features will be selected to determine trends. |
| Web Development | The framework for the website will be designed and built by using Streamlit. |
| Visualization | Data will be displayed by using Streamlit into the web application. |

Attributes that we may be interested in:
- video description
- video duration
- video create time
- video diggcount (likes)
- video sharecount

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture:

The system architecture consists of several components that work together to process and visualize data stored in a MongoDB database:

<p align="center">
  <img src="System Architecture.jpg" title="System Architecture">
</p>

1. Data scraping:
Use Tiktok Analytics API to scrape raw data such as username, number of likes and comments from Tiktok.

2. Data storage:
Use MongoDB to store the scraped data in a collection.

3. Data preprocessing and feature engineering:
Use the MongoDB Aggregation Framework to preprocess and transform the data as needed.
Perform feature engineering operations such as scaling, normalization, or polynomial expansion.

4. Visualization:
Use Streamlit to build a Tiktok Trend Dashboard that visualizes the preprocessed and feature-engineered data.
Use MongoDB as the data source for the dashboard.


Overall system architecture:

- Tiktok Analytics API for data scraping
- MongoDB for data storage and preprocessing
- Streamlit for data visualization
- A web server such as Flask or Django to serve the Streamlit dashboard
<!-- - A scheduler such as Cron or Airflow to automate the scraping and preprocessing tasks on a regular basis. -->


## üìå Risks and Limitations:

There are several risks and limitations that need to be considered when building TikTok Insights dashboard:

 1. Technical Risks:
	   - Server Infrastructure: Collecting and storing a large amount of data requires significant server infrastructure, including storage space, processing power, and memory. This can be expensive and requires careful planning to ensure optimal performance.
 2. Financial Risks:
	   -  Maintenance Costs: Once the project is complete, it requires ongoing maintenance and support to ensure its continued success. These costs should be factored into the project's overall budget.
 3. Legal Risks: 
	   - Consent: There is a risk of infringing on TikTok's terms of service, which prohibit web scraping and using data collected without consent.

It is important to identify and mitigate these risks when building a TikTok Insights dashboard to ensure that the dashboard is effective, financially viable, and legally compliant. We can implement appropriate data security and privacy measures, engaging legal experts to review the dashboard's compliance with relevant regulations, and carefully evaluating the financial costs and benefits of the project.
