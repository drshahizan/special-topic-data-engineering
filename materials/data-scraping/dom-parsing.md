# DOM Parsing
DOM (Document Object Model) parsing is a technique used in web scraping to extract data from the HTML code of a webpage. The DOM is a hierarchical representation of the webpage's HTML code, where each element in the HTML code is represented as a node in the DOM tree.

DOM parsing typically involves traversing the DOM tree using a parsing library like BeautifulSoup, lxml or html5lib, and extracting the data of interest from specific nodes or elements. Here's how DOM parsing typically works:

1. Obtain the HTML code of the webpage using a library like Requests.

2. Parse the HTML code into a DOM tree using a parsing library like BeautifulSoup, lxml, or html5lib.

3. Traverse the DOM tree to locate the elements containing the data of interest, using selectors like CSS selectors or XPath.

4. Extract the data of interest from the selected elements, using the appropriate methods of the parsing library, such as .text or .get.

5. Save the extracted data in a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file.

DOM parsing is a powerful technique for web scraping because it allows for the extraction of specific data elements from the HTML code, without having to extract all of the HTML code. However, it's important to note that the structure of the DOM tree can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the webpage being scraped, which can make DOM parsing a more complex technique than other scraping techniques like API scraping. Additionally, DOM parsing can be slower than other techniques, especially on large webpages with a lot of HTML code.
