## Introduction
Software engineering is an essential field of study that deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software applications. It plays a vital role in the development and success of modern technology. Here are some of the reasons why software engineering is important:


## Data Integration Architecture

## Data Integration Workflow
<br>

**What is Data Integration Workflow?**

The steps of integrating data from several sources, converting it into a common format, and putting it into a final system, like a data warehouse or data lake, is widely referred to as data integration workflow. It is critical to obtaining a unified perspective of an organization's data and is a fundamental part of contemporary data management. Organizations may increase data quality, eliminate mistakes, and optimize their data management procedures with the aid of a well-designed data integration strategy. No matter where or in what format their data is kept, it may also make it easier for them to access and use it. 

In the figure below, we have designed an easy to understand version of the data integration workflow. It is our own take on most high level data integration workflow used as a guideline to integrate data into systems.

## Data Integration Workflow Integration Breakpoints

## Data Integration Workflow Stages

To ensure that the process of integrating data and loading them into a system goes smoothly, we have guidelines that can be referred to. One of which is a Data Integration Workflow, there are several phases and steps in the data integration workflow depicted above. 

Table below explains each phase in the data integration workflow depicted above :
<br>
| No. | Phase | What is done during this phase? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Data Source Identification and Extraction | Identify the relevant data sources and extract the data from them for further processing. |
| 2. | Data Transformation & Integration | Transform the data from its original format to a format that can be integrated into the target system. The data is then integrated into the target system. |
| 3. | Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) | Create and manage an enterprise data warehouse to store and manage the integrated data. |
| 4. | Data Analysis and Reporting | Analysis and visualization of data for reporting for decision-making purposes. |
| 5. | Business Intelligence (BI) | Making use of BI tools to facilitate data analysis and reporting. |

Table below explains each phase in the data integration workflow depicted above :
<br><br>

| Step | What is done during this step? | Phase |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Identify data sources | Identifying the different sources of data is to be integrated, such as cloud-based services, databases, flat files, or web services. | Data Source Identification and Extraction |
| Extract data | Extract the data from each identified data source and store it in a staging area. [ Web Scraping, etc. ] | Data Source Identification and Extraction |
| Data Transformation | Transforming the extracted data into the desired format. [ Data mapping, cleansing, and formatting to ensure the data is consistent and accurate ] | Data Transformation & Integration |
| Data Integration | Integrating the transformed data into a data warehouse, which should be able to be accessed by various applications for reporting and analysis purposes. | Data Transformation & Integration |
| EDW Staging | Here the data is loaded into a staging area of the data warehouse for further processing. | Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) |
| Staged Data | A database environment where staged data is stored ready for processing. | Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) |
| EDW Integration | Here data is integrated into the enterprise data warehouse. This process involves data validation, cleansing, and standardization. | Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) |

| Data Quality Assessment | Here is where data is assessed for its quality, accuracy, completeness, and consistency to ensure that it is fit for analysis and reporting. | Data Analysis and Reporting |
| Data Analysis | Data is analyzed here, using various techniques such as descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. | Data Analysis and Reporting |
| Data Visualization | Here is where data is presented visually using interactive dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps. This process can be done using various BI Tools | Business Intelligence (BI) |
| Reporting | Here is where customized reports are generated based on user requirements. This process can be done using various BI Tools | Business Intelligence (BI) |
| BI Platform | A central platform that can be used to present findings from integrated data. | Business Intelligence (BI) |


## Data Integration Requirements

| Data Integration Requirements | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data Quality | Data being integrated should be accurate, complete, and consistent. Data profiling and cleansing can be used to improve data quality. |
| Data Mapping | The process of creating a connection between the data from different sources by identifying relationships between data elements and mapping them to a common format. |
| Data Transformation | The process of converting data from one format to another, done manually or automatically using ETL tools. |
| Data Integration Architecture | The design of the system used to integrate data, including identifying components and how they interact with each other. |
| Security | Protecting integrated data from unauthorized access as it may contain sensitive information. |
| Performance | Designing data integration to minimize the time required and ensure timely availability without affecting system performance. |
| Scalability | Data integration system should be able to handle large amounts of data without compromising performance. |
| Governance | Data integration should be governed by policies and procedures consistent with the organization's overall data governance strategy. |


## Data Integration Design
Data Integration design is the act of merging data from many sources into a unified perspective that can be easily accessed and analysed. The purpose is to provide a complete and accurate perspective of data to aid decision-making and business operations.

1. ``Gathering of requirements``: This entails comprehending the data sources, their formats, and the business requirements for data integration.
2. ``Data profiling``: In this step, the data is analysed to determine its structure, quality, and completeness.
3. ``Data mapping``: During this stage, data from various sources is mapped to a single data model. This entails determining the connections between the data and the attributes that must be incorporated.
4. ``Data transformation``: During this phase, the data is converted from its original format to a format that can be easily integrated.
5. ``Data quality validation``: Assessing the quality of the integrated data, including accuracy, completeness, and consistency checks.
6. ``Deployment``: In this phase, the combined data is deployed to the production environment.

## Data Integration Tools and Types

- What are Data Integration Tool
    
    Data integration tools are software applications that help organizations to combine and manage data from different sources. These tools typically provide features such     as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data cleansing, data mapping, and data synchronization.

- Types of Data Integration Tool
    1. ``On-premise Data Integration Tool`` : On-premise data integration tools are software applications that are installed and run on a company's own servers or hardware          infrastructure.
