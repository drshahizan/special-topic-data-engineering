# Types of Data

Data can be classified into three main types: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

1. Structured Data:
   - Structured data is highly organized and follows a predefined format.
   - It is typically stored in relational databases with a fixed schema.
   - Examples include data in tables with rows and columns, such as financial transactions or customer information.

2. Semi-Structured Data:
   - Semi-structured data does not have a rigid schema but contains some organizational elements.
   - It may have tags, labels, or attributes that provide some level of organization.
   - Examples include JSON or XML documents, log files, or social media posts.

3. Unstructured Data:
   - Unstructured data has no predefined structure or organization.
   - It does not fit into traditional relational databases easily.
   - Examples include text documents, emails, images, videos, or sensor data.

## NoSQL Database

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that offer flexible and scalable solutions for handling different types of data. NoSQL databases are designed to handle the limitations of traditional relational databases and provide better performance, scalability, and agility.

Types of NoSQL databases include:

1. Document Databases:
   - Examples: MongoDB, Couchbase
   - Store data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
   - Suitable for managing semi-structured and unstructured data with varying schemas.
   - Allow for flexible data modeling and horizontal scalability.

2. Key-Value Databases:
   - Examples: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB
   - Store data as key-value pairs.
   - Provide simple and fast data access by key.
   - Efficient for high-speed caching, session management, and real-time applications.

3. Columnar Databases:
   - Examples: Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase
   - Organize data into columns rather than rows.
   - Efficiently handle large-scale distributed data and support high write and read throughput.
   - Suitable for storing and analyzing large volumes of time-series or analytical data.

4. Graph Databases:
   - Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune
   - Store data as nodes and edges to represent complex relationships between entities.
   - Optimize for graph-based queries and traversals, making them suitable for social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.

For example, MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database. It allows storing and retrieving data in flexible JSON-like documents. With MongoDB, you can easily handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as product catalogs, user profiles, or sensor data, while providing scalability and performance.

### 🔗[MongoDB](mongodb.md)
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. It provides scalability, high performance, and dynamic schema design, making it suitable for handling unstructured and semi-structured data in various applications.
