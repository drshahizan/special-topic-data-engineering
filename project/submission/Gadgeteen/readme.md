 <p align='justify'>This project aims to <b>develop a social media monitoring tool to understand public opinion and sentiment on ChatGPT in Malaysia</b>. The project will collect and process social media data from Reddit, perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and develop visualizations and dashboards to present the results of the analysis. The insights gained from the analysis will be used to provide recommendations for further development of ChatGPT. The project has the potential to provide valuable insights into public opinion and sentiment about ChatGPT, and help OpenAI to make data-driven decisions and improve its products and services. Below are the key benefits of this project:</p>

1. **Identify areas for improvement in ChatGPT**: By analyzing the sentiment of tweets about ChatGPT, the project can identify features that users are happy with, as well as features that could be improved. This information can be used to make changes to ChatGPT that will make it more user-friendly and appealing to users.

2. **Identify potential new features for ChatGPT**: The project can also identify topics that are frequently discussed in posts about ChatGPT. These topics could be potential new features for ChatGPT, or they could be areas where ChatGPT could be improved.

3. **Improve the communication between OpenAI and the ChatGPT community:** The project can provide a platform for OpenAI to communicate with users about ChatGPT. This will help OpenAI to get feedback from users and to keep them informed about the development of ChatGPT.

 <p align='justify'>Overall, the project has the potential to provide a number of key benefits for OpenAI and the ChatGPT community. By providing real-time insights into public opinion and sentiment about ChatGPT, the project can help OpenAI to make data-driven decisions about the development of ChatGPT and to improve the popularity and usage of ChatGPT.</p>
