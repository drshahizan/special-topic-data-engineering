<h2 align='center'>Introduction</h2>
The purpose of this report is to document the process of extracting data from an Application Programming Interface (API) using a client library (SDK) and subsequently storing the data in a CSV file. The extracted data will then be uploaded into a MongoDB database for further analysis and utilization. In addition, the primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the retrieval of data from a Malaysia News API using a client library. The data obtained from the API will be saved into a CSV file, providing a structured format for easy storage and analysis. Additionally, the report will cover the steps involved in uploading the CSV data into a MongoDB database, enabling efficient querying and manipulation of the dataset.
