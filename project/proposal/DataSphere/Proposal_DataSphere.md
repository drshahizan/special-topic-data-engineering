## üìñ: Executive Summary 
To comprehend the feelings, thoughts, and attitudes that individuals have towards a certain subject, good, service, or brand, sentiment analysis is a technique that involves mining and analysing huge volumes of data. It is an effective tool that may be utilised to understand consumer behaviour, forecast trends, and guide corporate decisions. Sentiment analysis is a cutting-edge field that effectively classifies and interprets the sentiment of text, speech, and video data by utilising cutting-edge technology like machine learning and natural language processing. Sentiment analysis is being used by businesses to track consumer feedback, social media trends, brand reputation, and enhance the overall customer experience. Despite its many advantages, sentiment analysis has certain drawbacks, such as the potential for bias, the difficulty of deciphering sarcasm, and the problem of maintaining accuracy across diverse languages and cultures. Sentiment analysis will be a crucial tool for companies looking to stay on the cutting edge of customer knowledge and requirements fulfilment as technology develops.

## üñºÔ∏è: Background
<p align="justify">
The sentiment analysis project focused on analyzing mental health-related discussions and sentiments expressed on Twitter. Twitter serves as a valuable platform for individuals to share their thoughts, experiences, and emotions related to mental health. By scraping and analyzing tweets from Twitter, this project aimed to gain insights into the sentiment and attitudes surrounding mental health topics on the platform.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and it has garnered increased attention in recent years. Understanding the sentiments expressed by individuals on social media platforms like Twitter provides a unique opportunity to explore public perceptions, experiences, and reactions to mental health issues.
</p>

<p align="justify">
By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, this project sought to uncover important insights. These insights include identifying prevalent sentiment trends, understanding the emotional impact of specific mental health topics, detecting influential or viral tweets, and observing how sentiment evolves over time.

## üî¨: Scope
The objective of this project is to provide insights to policymakers, citizens of the world and organisations participating in this program, on where Mental Health excels and where it finds the short end of the stick. With this known, the scope of this project will be :

- ``Data Source`` : Scraped tweets and information of their respective *tweeters*. Multiple tools will be used to gather data, including **snscrape**. **snscrape** is a web scraping tool that utilizes the APIs of various social media platforms. It accesses the APIs of social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit to gather data from them.
- ``Tools & Technologies`` : Retrieved data will be stored in MongoDB. Which then will be cleaned and prepared using **Pandas** and **Numpy**. Natural language processing (NLP) will be used to analyse tweets and retrieve information from them, libraries such as **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** will be used for this function. To group tweets with similar sentiments clustering algorithms using **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** libraries will be applied on the cleaned data. Finally, Findings will be visualised using **Tableau**.
- ``Resources`` : 
  - Team of 5 people.
  - Each team member posses skills from gathering appropriate data to visualising data, using tools and technologies listed.
  - Adequate hardware and software to progress.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è: Methodology
- ``Data collection`` : Scrape data from Twitter on responses and tweets of mental health using twitter API.


- ``Data cleaning and processing`` : The collected data will be cleaned, filtered, pre-processed to remove duplicate data using Python.

- ``Data analysis`` : Data analysis utilizing descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis methods comes after the data have been cleaned. This will make it easier to spot patterns and trends in the information.

- ``Machine learning algorithms`` : Based on the gathered data, machine learning algorithms can be utilized to anticipate the customer choice. Hence, can build a model utilizing supervised learning methods like regression or classification.

- ``Data visualization`` : Use data visualization approaches to illustrate the relationship between product feature patterns, analysis, and machine learning algorithms. Tools like Tableau and Python packages like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used for this.


## üíª: System Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:

| No. | Components | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Data Acquisition | To acquire data, we will use the Twitter API to collect tweets on "Mental Health" We will connect with the Twitter API using Python's **Snscrape** package and save the collected data in JSON format. |
| 2. | Data Storage | For storing the acquired data, we will use **MongoDB** as our primary database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that works well with massive amounts of unstructured data, such as tweets. To interface with the database, we will use PyMongo, a Python library for MongoDB. |
| 3. | Data preprocessing | We will clean and preprocess the data before evaluating it. To normalize the text data, we will remove stop words, punctuation, and URLs, as well as perform stemming and lemmatization. For text preparation and feature engineering, we will use Python's **NLTK** module. |
| 4. | Data analysis and modeling | We will train a sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data. We will train the model using labeled data using a supervised learning approach. For model training and evaluation, we will employ Python's Scikit-Learn package. We will also investigate additional models, such as deep learning approaches, utilizing frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. |
| 5. | Model deployment |**Django**, a Python-based web framework, will be used by the model deployment component to deploy machine learning models to a web server. Predictions based on user input will be provided via API endpoints. Setting up a continuous integration and delivery pipeline will also be part of the deployment to ensure that the models are up to date and accurate. |
| 6. | Model monitoring and maintenance | The model monitoring and maintenance component will continuously monitor the models' performance and retrain them as needed. MongoDB's change stream feature, which provides real-time notifications when data changes, will be used for monitoring. Updating the models to account for new data sources and changing customer behaviour will be part of the maintenance. |
| 7. | Visualization and reporting | We will use **Streamlit**, a Python library for building interactive web applications, to visualize the sentiment analysis results. We will also use **Power BI or Tableau** to create reports and dashboards that can be shared with stakeholders. |
| 8. | Workflow and collaboration | To track progress, assign tasks, and collaborate with team members, the workflow and collaboration component will use project management tools like **Trello** or **Asana**. In addition, the team will use version control software such as Git to ensure that all changes to the codebase are tracked and easily reversible. |
