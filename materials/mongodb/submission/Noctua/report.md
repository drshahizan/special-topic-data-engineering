## Introduction: 

In today's digital age, book rating system can play a role in shaping readers' choices, influencing book sales, and contributing to the overall book ecosystem. Our group is excited to embark on a collaborative assignment to develop a book rating system using MongoDB as the database and PHP as the backend scripting language. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Visual Studio Code, we aim to create a robust and user-friendly platform that streamlines the book rating with readers satisfaction.

The primary objective of our assignment is to provide a standardized and accessible way for readers to evaluate and compare books. By integrating MongoDB as the database and PHP for backend development, we will leverage the flexibility, scalability, and real-time data handling capabilities of these technologies. Our goal is to create a reliable and efficient platform that collect books rating with different reader's perspective and empowers authors to provide better ideas and improve their writing skills.

## System Design: 
*Describe the system architecture, data requirements, and functionalities.*

### Data Requirements

The data requirements include storing and managing books data. Some of the essential data fields are as follows:

<div align="center">
  
| Field               | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| User ID             | A unique identifier for each user.                           |
| Name                | The user's name.                                             |
| Email               | The user's email address.                                    |

| Book Title          | The book's title.                                            |
| Book Image          | The book's image.                                            | 
| Review ID           | A unique identifier for each review.                         | 
| Rating              | User rating with at most 5 stars.                            |

</div>

### Functionalities

The key functionalities of the system are as follows:
1. **Create user, book and reviews**: Users can register and login into the system, admin add books into the system and users add book reviews with ratings.
2. **Read book reviews**: Users can read the reviews added for specific books.
3. **Update reviews**: Users can update their particular reviews added.
4. **Delete reviews**: Users can delete their reviews.

## Implementation

### Required Software
Some of the software that need to be install are as follows:

1. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html): Open localhost and SQL database.<br>
2. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community): Store data locally. <br>
3. [MongoDB PHP Driver](https://pecl.php.net/package/mongodb): Connect with mongodb database. Download driver that are compatible with your php version. <br>
4. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/): Dependency management in PHP.

### Steps
1.  Open downloaded mongodb php driver and copy 'php_mongodb.dll' file into *C:\xampp\php\ext* folder.

2.  Add the following line in *C:\xampp\php\php.ini*
```
extension=php_mongodb.dll
```

3. Open directory in command prompt or powershell, then install the PHP Library with Composer.
```
composer require mongodb/mongodb
```

4. Open local host and phpmyadmin (MySQL) to create a database with table user, posts and reviews.

  <img src="images/tb_posts.png" alt="Centered Image">
  <img src="images/tb_reviews.png" alt="Centered Image">
</p>

5. Create database and collection in mongodb compass of localhost: 27017.
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/mongodb1.png" alt="Centered Image">
</p>

6. Run MongoDB server by running the code below in command prompt run as administrator.
```
net start MongoDB
```

7. Create new file in your directory to connect to **MySQL**.
```
<?php 

   $db_name = 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=reviews_db';
   $db_user_name = 'root';
   $db_user_pass = '';

   $conn = new PDO($db_name, $db_user_name, $db_user_pass);

   function create_unique_id(){
      $characters = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
      $characters_lenght = strlen($characters);
      $random_string = '';
      for($i = 0; $i < 20; $i++){
         $random_string .= $characters[mt_rand(0, $characters_lenght - 1)];
      }
      return $random_string;
   }

   if(isset($_COOKIE['user_id'])){
      $user_id = $_COOKIE['user_id'];
   }else{
      $user_id = '';
   }

?>
```

8. Create new file in your directory to connect to **MongoDB**.
```
<?php
      require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Include the MongoDB PHP driver

      // Connect to MongoDB
      $mongoClient = new MongoDB\Client("mongodb://localhost:27017");

      // Select a database
      $database = $mongoClient->selectDatabase('db_book');
      $collection = $database->selectCollection('books');
  ?>
```

### CRUD operations
1. **Create user, posts and reviews**: tb_user need id, name, email, password and image (optional).tb_posts need id, title and image, tb_reviews need id, post id, user id, rating, title, description and date (timestamp).
2. **Read posts and reviews**: Any type of user can see both posts and reviews.
3. **Update posts and reviews**: Admin can update posts, all user can update reviews.
4. **Delete posts and reviews**: Admin can delete posts, all user can delete reviews.
