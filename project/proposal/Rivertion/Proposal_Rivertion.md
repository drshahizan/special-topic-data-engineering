## üìù Background:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://icanandiam.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/72596-rotten-fruit-oranges-getty-delfinkina-1200.1200w.tn_.jpg" alt="Playground" height="250"></img>

Rotten fruits are a significant problem in the fruit industry, leading to economic losses, food waste, and even potential health risks for consumers. The detection of rotten fruits is a crucial step in the fruit production chain to ensure that only high-quality fruits reach the market. Manual inspection by human operators is the most common method used for detecting rotten fruits, but it can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to human error. Automated systems for detecting rotten fruits using image analysis have been proposed as a more efficient and reliable alternative to manual inspection.

Early attempts at automated fruit quality inspection relied on simple image processing techniques such as color and texture analysis. These techniques could only achieve limited accuracy and were sensitive to lighting conditions and camera angles. In recent years, advances in machine learning algorithms and computer vision have enabled more sophisticated approaches for fruit quality inspection. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be highly effective for image classification tasks, including fruit quality inspection.

Several studies have investigated the use of CNNs for detecting rotten fruits. For example, one study used a deep learning approach to classify apples as healthy or rotten based on images taken from different viewpoints. Another study proposed a method for detecting rot in apples using a combination of texture and color features.

Despite the progress made in automated fruit quality inspection, several challenges still need to be addressed. One major  challenge is the integration of image analysis systems into the fruit production chain, ensuring that the system is scalable, user-friendly, and cost-effective.

In summary, automated systems for detecting rotten fruits using image analysis have the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of fruit quality control. Recent advancements in machine learning algorithms and computer vision have enabled more sophisticated approaches for fruit quality inspection. However, several challenges still need to be addressed, including the development of a diverse image dataset and the integration of image analysis systems into the fruit production chain.

## üìÑ Methodology:

The proposed data science project for developing a Image Analysis System for Fruit Rotten Detection will be executed using the following methodology:

1. ``Data Collection``
  	<ul>
 		<li>The project will use the Pixabay API to scrape fruit images from the internet. It supports automatic image and video optimization, including compression and quality adjustments, to enhance performance and reduce bandwidth consumption. Specifically, the project will utilize Pixabay API to search for fruit images and download them in bulk. The API will be configured to search for a variety of fruits and retrieve both healthy and rotten images. Each image will be labeled as healthy or rotten for training the model.</li>
  	</ul>
2. ``Data Cleaning and Preprocessing``
  	<ul>
  		<li>The collected dataset will be preprocessed to enhance image quality and extract features relevant to fruit quality. Preprocessing steps may include resizing, cropping, normalization, and color correction to ensure consistency across all images. The images will also be converted to grayscale and segmented to extract fruit regions from the background. Feature extraction techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) will be applied to extract relevant features from the segmented fruit regions.</li>
  	</ul>
3. ``Model Selection and Training``
  	<ul>
  		<li>A deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), will be trained on the preprocessed dataset to accurately classify fruits as healthy or rotten. The model will be optimized by adjusting hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. A separate validation dataset will be used to evaluate the model's performance and make any necessary adjustments.</li>
  	</ul>
4. ``Model Evaluation and Comparison``
  	<ul>
  		<li>The accuracy of the developed system will be evaluated using a separate test dataset that was not used during the training or validation process. The performance of the system will be compared to existing methods for fruit quality control, such as manual inspection and traditional image processing techniques.</li>
  	</ul>
5. ``Data Visualization``
  	<ul>
  		<li>The results of the analysis will be displayed in a user-friendly interface, allowing for easy input of fruit images and displaying the results of the analysis. The system may also generate visualizations, such as heatmaps or bar charts, to provide insights into the performance of the model.</li>
  	</ul>
