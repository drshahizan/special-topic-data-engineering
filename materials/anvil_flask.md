### **Framework Comparison: Anvil vs Flask**

| Feature                  | **Anvil**                                                            | **Flask**                                                         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**          | GUI-based, drag-and-drop interface; beginner-friendly.              | Lightweight, highly customizable but requires more coding effort. |
| **Backend Integration**  | Built-in Python server; seamless integration.                       | Requires manual setup for server and backend logic.              |
| **Frontend Development** | Built-in editor; can integrate Bootstrap easily.                    | Full control over frontend using Jinja2 templates or Bootstrap.  |
| **Database Support**     | Built-in database or external databases (e.g., MySQL).              | Supports MySQL through ORM (SQLAlchemy) or raw queries.          |
| **File Upload**          | Easy to implement, direct support for handling file uploads.        | File uploads require custom implementation.                      |
| **Scalability**          | Limited by Anvil's hosting (unless self-hosted with open-source).   | Highly scalable, suitable for complex, production-grade apps.    |
| **Learning Curve**       | Low; designed for rapid prototyping.                               | Moderate; more suitable for experienced developers.              |
