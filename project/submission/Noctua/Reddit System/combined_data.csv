Hope they can do it though!

Edit: Any info on who actually is part of the Gov't now (apart from Prime Minister)? I see that PN suddenly want 'Unity Gov't' but did they change their minds before or after Anwar got the numbers from (BN & East Malaysia)?

comment,,12,ixlkiwx,,1669285302.0,"Congratulations to Anwar on finally, finally, achieving his dream of becoming PM. Hope he lasts longer than 2 years than the previous 3 PMs.

Having the Anti-Hopping Law makes a whole world of difference.

Before AHL, Numbers Man was unable to control individual rogue elements within the parties that he wanted to court. As there is little to no risk in betraying Anwar before.

But with the AHL now in force, parties wishing to join Anwar must now decide en bloc, any differences must be meshed out, and dissenters either shut up or resign their seats. 

The added risk of having to resign and go through another by-election means they will mostly just shut up despite moaning about it. (LOL at Wee Ka-siong having shit on his face. You know how pathetic MCA's become when even Mr. Phakkyu shits on them. )

Of course, AHL is not perfect as it does not apply to solo kataks like Larry. And BN can always just bolt and join Moo anytime they like. 

But unlike last time, where we were mostly caught by complete surprise by traitors coming from the *inside* PH. This time we are actually *aware* of their potential treachery as the enemies are all *outside* of PH. As the old saying goes ""Keep your friends close but your enemies closer"". Having the threat of BN leaving anytime means Anwar must stay vigilant and prevents PH from going complacent.

I'm under no illusion that this Unity Gov't will do much, but even incrementally, something can still be done. Let UMNO take all the ""glamorous"" cabinet roles, where they will no doubt make fuckups after fuckups, as in their nature.

Meanwhile PKR and DAP and Amanah keep quiet and take the small ministries that actually gets work done, like Transport, Health, Telecommunications, Sports etc. That's all I ask for.

Maybe after 2 years, when BN is surely getting restless, then Anwar can call a snap election, and use the results from these small ministries as proof to the rakyat that PH is the coalition for actually getting work done. 

That's how UK's Labour Party won in a landslide in 1945 after being in eternal opposition for so long, because they were under a Unity Government with Churchill. While Churchill focuses on fighting Hitler, Labour focused on the domestic ministries that gets work done, and then use the results of these ministries to show voters how they can fix the country after the war. (Whether you agree or disagree with UK Labour's policies is not the point of this example)

The battle for GE16 has just begun. Maybe I'll put my thoughts out about how PH can win more seats after learning from mistakes and lessons in GE15 in a future post.",2022-11-24 18:21:42

JALAN TUANKU ABDUL HALIM 50480 KUALA LUMPUR

MEDIA STATEMENT

Kuala Lumpur, 24 November 2022 - It is to be informed that His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta'in Billah has agreed to attend and chair the King's Special Discussion with the Malay Rulers at Istana Negara, today.

At the Special Discussion session which started at 11.00 that morning, His Majesty was pleased to ask Their Majesties the Malay Rulers about the process of appointing a new Prime Minister following the 15th General Election (GE15) on 19 November 2022.

The Special Discussion is also intended for His Majesty to get the views of Their Majesties the Malay Rulers to enable him to make the best decision for the interests and well-being of the country and the rakyat.

The process mentioned above is to enable His Majesty to make a decision to appoint a member of the Dewan Rakyat who in His Majesty's judgement is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of the Dewan Rakyat as Prime Minister in accordance with Article 40(2)(a) and Article 43(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution.

After refining the views of Their Majesties the Malay Rulers, His Majesty has given his consent to appoint the Honorable Dato' Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim (Member of Parliament P.063, Tambun) as the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia in accordance with the authority His Majesty who is provided under Section 40(2)(a) and Article 43(2)(a) of the Federal Constitution.

The next process is the Ceremony of Awarding the Deed of Appointment and the Ceremony of Taking the Oath of Office and Loyalty as well as the Oath of Secrecy as Prime Minister which is scheduled to take place at 5.00 pm today at the Istana Negara.

His Majesty reminded all parties that the winners do not win it all and the losers do not lose it all. Thus, as the duckweeds bunch together again after a boat passes through, reaching out to each other to close ranks again among all the members of the Dewan Rakyat for the future of our beloved country. *(editor's note: idiom of duckweeds refer to reconciliation after quarrels.)*

His Majesty affirmed that this country is like an inheritance where the leaders are the trustees. This heritage needs to be taken care of because it will be inherited by the young generation who will lead the country straight to the pinnacle of success.

His Majesty also ordered the Prime Minister and His Majesty's new Government that will be formed to be like the rice plant‚Äîthe fuller it is, the more it bows. The fact is, the common people should not be burdened with endless political turmoil when the country needs a stable Government to stimulate the economic landscape and development of the country. *(editor's note: idiom of rice plant refers to the need for the rich and powerful to be humble.)*

The members of the Dewan Rakyat who have been elected by the rakyat are also reminded to show solidarity by giving priority, high commitment and the best service to the rakyat.

His Majesty also expressed his appreciation for the continued support of Their Majesties the Malay Rulers in fulfilling his responsibilities as the constitutional monarch based on the supremacy of the Federal Constitution and the Rule of Law.
Their Majesties the Malay Rulers also support His Majesty's position for the formation of a stable Government as soon as possible following PRUI5 through a careful and thorough process and in-depth observation.

His Majesty expressed his utmost gratitude to Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala and called on the rakyat to continue to be steadfast and calm and pray together that the country will always be blessed, blessed and under the protection of Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala, away from any disaster and calamity.

Dato' Seri Ahmad Fadil Shamsuddin Dato' Grand Chamberlain of the Istana Negara

He wants to get the support of as many people as possible, so that if UMNO or GPS decides to pull out, he can immediately rally the people to direct their anger to UMNO or GPS....*see, they don't want unity, they are greedy, they don't care about the people, not like me*

One of another finding that I find it interesting is that people analyze Obama's watch. He wore a Tag Heuer diver watch that cost less than USD 600; a working class watch.

[Onn Hafiz's 37k(!) shoes](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2022/07/11/expensive-shoes-a-gift-from-sultan-says-johor-mb/) (also from the same Sultan)

[Annuar Musa's 953k(!) watch](https://worldofbuzz.com/annuar-musa-talks-about-poverty-in-kl-netizens-more-interested-in-his-luxury-watch/) (never explained, and seen during a speech on urban poverty!).

Sabri's 5-7k multiple eye-wateringly [terrible](https://twitter.com/SHIVA9389/status/1530098167676825600?s=20&t=vWGKJ-9cemxyuxOIUWggIg) [Burberry shirts](https://twitter.com/LagaCawan/status/1540990397438078976?s=20&t=zfJBOiHDJYDaJLRYQ8KKrg), and [290k watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/v3ycwk/from_the_suara_rakyat_facebook_page_any_watch/).

Moo comes of reasonable, with his [""only"" 11.5k watch](https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5217803/all) (which also helped to bust the fact that he was delivering recorded pengutusans)

And of course, super champions [Zahid, KJ, and Hishamuddin](https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/294993):

*According to the photos, Zahid is wearing a Richard Mille RM033 (RM293,000) and a ‚Äòcheaper‚Äô IWC Portuguese Perpetual Calander (RM180,000).*

*It also pointed out that Khairy was wearing a RM160,000 Patek Philippe Nautilus and a Jaegar Reverso, which its price range between RM27,000 and RM180,000.*

*While Hishammuddin had two Audemars Piguet watches, one is Royal Oak Offshore Chronograph Black Ceramic Bezel (estimated more than RM70,000) and the second one is Royal Oak, estimated to be worth more than RM50,000.*

Retired grand master Najib just gets a dishonorable mention in the same article:

*And the most expensive one is the Hublot Big Bang King Power ‚ÄòRed Devils‚Äô Manchester United limited edition, at RM165,000. Najib is a well-known fan of the Manchester United football team.*

*The rest of Najib‚Äôs watches are Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Carbon (RM120,000), Harry Winston Project Z2 (RM97,500), and Hublot BB Black Magic Black Ceramics (RM50,000).*

Look, people can have nice things, and gods know that the quickest route to wealth is being a long term UMNO politician.

Because of our history Malaysia talks about certain issues such as race very differently from Western countries. We acknowledge this on the subreddit but do draw some boundaries to keep discussions healthy.

> * Definition of bigotry: The act of treating the members of a group (such as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.

> * Basic principle: If it's an attribute of a person that is out of their control and extremely hard or impossible to change, it's not nice to dump on them or their group just for that attribute. 

> * Some categories this applies to: Race, religion, sexuality, disability, national origin.

> * Slurs: Use of slurs on the above categories is not encouraged on this subreddit and may be subject to warnings and bans.

> * Example: Religion: It's okay to discuss and criticise aspects of the religion itself, but it's not okay to attack people because they are members of that religion (e.g.: Islam but not Muslims).

Classic example of users who conclude that we are biased in favour of one race or the other without considering this:

* Vast majority of racist posts and comments that get removed on a daily basis, because we have removed them. Unless you go through every post, every parent comment, there is no way you can see what we do each day. Do you go through every post and comment, since you claimed below that ""time is not on your side""? If no, your assertion that we do fuck all carries no weight.
* We routinely remove comments which are racist against every race (in a given week every race gets dinged at least a couple of times)
* The mod team consists of a group of ppl who also have full-time jobs on top of moderating this sub, which has grown 10 times the size it was compared to a few years ago. Do you think we refresh the mod queue every 5 minutes or so? 

Nyets performing checks and balances? Fair, we will occasionally make a bad call. But to claim that we ""do fuck all"", that annoys me to no end because it's such an unfair assessment.",2022-11-30 07:22:34

comment,,13,isb6mz2,,1665766892.0,"Here is my take on this situation, pure speculation.

Normally the UMNO president is the country PM.

But it become weird when Najib lose election in 2018, first time in this country history.
Many people in Malaysia cannot accept such corrupted person I guess. So they quickly change him to Party Advisor and Zahid, the vice PM take over UMNO 

But since they are lose the election, Zahid cannot become PM.
Then Bersatu decide to jump ship and join UMNO. Bersatu become PM for weird reason, they don't even have majority seat themselves. Covid happen and Muyhiddin reputation is fallen. UMNO realize they are the one with most seat , they don't have to bow down to Bersatu. Thus they successfully take over the PM seat. But Zahid - still the UMNO President -, have a lot of court case against him, he knew he might get same result like Najib in 2018.

He let his UMNO vice president to be PM, until he clear all his court cases,and now he is ready to contest.

Of course, I doubt Penyu going to let go so easily. If UMNO win this election, they will have party election and that should decide who will be Leader/PM",2022-10-15 01:01:32

comment,,7,iyp2wmy,,1670030819.0,"Yeah it's kinda obvious not many get what I mean. There are cases where seeing 2 cars ahead helps especially in packed city highways, cause the car immediately infront might not be paying attention/playing with their phone and not realise the car infront of them braked cause the traffic stopped, and there might be an inevitable crash. 

In this case if you can see 2 cars ahead and that 2nd car ahead brakes while the car immediately infront doesn't brake, you can at least pre empt and not accelerate/brake yourself to avoid the potential crash as well

This is why alot of fender benders on highways in the city with jams tend to involve 3 or more cars, each car reacts to the car infront of them only and there's no space/time to react if the car infront gets into a fender bender in jams",2022-12-03 09:26:59

Gobind is nearly the furthest thing from ""independent"", unfortunately. Having a sitting MP as Dewan Rakyat speaker frankly offends the Westminster tradition, as many have done: [the post today is a de facto **moderator** between all MPs](https://www.ipu.org/news/news-in-brief/2021-09/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-speakers-parliament).

Unfortunately, I know a lot of people don't think like that, they can't see beyond the surface. But I still believe they should accept it (if offered a post) regardless of what people think, provided they do what's right while on the job. Someone has to do it eventually.

comment,,11,iyqo34t,,1670069616.0,"IMHO, if an MP of Gobind's standing denies it, then a rumor is as good as false. Or, if you're insinuating Gobind is issuing false denials (better to keep quiet than literally lie), he **definitely** doesn't have any ""principled"" opposition to Zahid: he's just protecting a brand that he knows gets votes, but he doesn't care about.

I don't think that's true; I think Gobind just genuinely doesn't see it as a ""big"" problem. I can disagree, but Gobind seems clear. And many DAP MPs‚Äînamely Gobind‚Äî happily joined ultra-corrupt Mahathir's Cabinet. Which DAP MP denied Mahathir's Cabinet appointments?

In the end, I don't see evidence any DAP MPs *sincerely* preferred Muhyiddin as PM and ""PH to be a credible opposition"". DAP don't like the current government either, but they must've all known coming into GE15 that should they ever become a Minister, it would be under a PH+PN or PH+BN banner.

If people root for you to be in the cabinet and make positive changes, and you turn it down just so someone else (who may be a crook, may be not), then that's selfish. You turn your back on the people who supported you. It's almost like PN not wanting to work together with PH in a unity government. People voted for you to be the government, but you reject the chance on 'principle'. Personally, I'll be disappointed and I find that self-centered (I know there are quite a lot of people who disagree and applaud them for their 'principles'. That's why I say it's just about saving face. Work is not just about principles, it's also about getting things done. Values are important, but so are results). That's the gist of what I'm saying.

Again, the gist of it is that I don't agree they should reject a post on principle.

""If you do not agree on what the MP decided to do, next election do not vote for him.""
>I can't really do that to the main MP this thread is about, I don't live in his constituency.

And again, in case you have forgotten, these are my views  and my stance on what he should do. It's my belief ‚Äì my principle ‚Äì not to turn away responsibility when you have the chance to do good. 

>When people vote based on party, its hard to distinguish what the majority actually wants.

Why is it hard to distinguish? The majority actually wants what the party wants/belief in/promise etc?

comment,,8,ix7pnp4,,1669030641.0,"Unfortunately for them, Malaysia will go into a recession very very quickly if they actually ban non-muslims from doing their own thing. This actually impacts on a wider scale as tourists and investors will be driven away. A lot of Malay business relies on tourists to survive. All the homestay, beach activities, car rental, seaside restaurants, etc are operated by Malays themselves.

For example. Terengganu does not ban alcohol in 5 star hotels as they rely heavily of foreign tourists. MAS does not ban alcohol as they cater for foreign and richer class of people. Why do investors bring in billions of dollars into Penang and Selangor every year instead of Kelantan or Terengganu? This is because the state governments are moderate and signals to the investors that they will have a level of freedom when they step foot on their states. We rely on taxes and inflow of investors money to pay the salary and quality of life.

By comparison, how many people here plan a 1 week holiday tour to Saudi Arabia with their entire family? In the same manner, how many people here plan a 1 week holiday to Japan or Thailand? How many people have vision to migrate to Jordan, Egypt or Saudi? By contrast, how many people have vision to migrate to Australia or Europe?

For those religious people here, name me one country with Theocratic government that is very popular, rich and successful in the world today.

It's just a matter of time if we head this direction and it'll be very very hard to get rid of institutionalized racism and theocratic government.

Every theocratic government in existence today is under developed, strife with civil war, civilians living in poverty or on the brink of a failed state. Europe is a good example how the church and politics separated after the dark age, leading to enlightened period and become world super powers through science. China also did the same thing and transformed into a super power within a Asian of 30 years.

My thin foil hat brain think they purposely not to mention *WHEN* and *HOW* they get this cost reduction numbers in their main speech, only explains it in details in a MoT statement where only train enthusiasts care enough to read it thoroughly, so that the general public will have an illusion where ""PH government save RM11 billion on ECRL shortly after becoming government after GE15"", which is misleading and not true.",2022-12-24 14:16:53

I don't think I'm likely to change anyone's mind completely based off just this explanation, but I'm hoping to provide a few thoughts about this opinion that aren't clearly just subtle ""fuck religion lol"" troll comments

Based on another comment on this post - to be clear I think burning a rainbow flag should also be allowed - I believe burning, defacing, or destroying any form of property should be legal no matter the context of the item so long as it is your own legal property, acquired legally. If you're stealing someone else's religious text, flag, or other symbol to destroy it - that's a different matter which is already illegal under theft laws.

Sensitive issues are precisely the sort of issue that free speech rights are designed to protect - if the thing we wanted to say in public had no objections from anyone, there would be no legal need to protect that speech. Ronald Dworkin in *Taking Rights Seriously* writes about the theory of Rights as Trumps - Rights are fundamental laws which allow individuals to trump group interests or desires. The main thing that makes a Right different from some other privilege or easement in law is the fact that a Right is vested in the individual person and can restrain other individuals, or the government, from compelling or preventing that person to act in a certain way. I have a right to bodily freedom - it is unlawful for any person to touch or harm my body without my consent, and no one can prevent me from doing what I want to my own body (tattoos, piercings, etc.) 

Rights are important because they fundamentally assure that the state and other people in society are bound to limit their ability to interfere with us on important issues without our consent. These preserve our fundamental freedom as individuals in a constitutional democracy. So it is important to ensure that, if we are going to limit or restrict Rights, we must do so very carefully, proportionally, and in a way that limits the ability to exploit that restriction into Tyranny.

The classic example is ""You cannot shout 'Fire' in a crowded theatre"" - this is a restriction on freedom of speech that applies because exercising speech in this manner would prejudice and harm the freedom of life/bodily safety that other people in the theatre have. The point: restrictions on Rights can be justified if their exercise will damage the Rights of other(s).

With that in mind, the question must be: does burning a sacred text jeopardise the rights of others? The immediate answer is: yes, it offends the right to practice religion freely. But does it? If someone burns a Bible, does that stop me from practicing my religion? I can be offended, certainly. I can wish the person didn't do that thing, I can pray for him, I can protest peacefully about what happened. What I cannot do is damage his home or property, or intimidate or attack his person - this would be infringing on his Right to safety and property. 

Whilst you certainly have a right to religion, it does not appear as certain that you have a right to religion without criticism or being offended. If something being considered sacred by someone was sufficient justification to restrict speech, we would surely not be able to call out Ustazs performing child marriages, child sexual abuses by Catholic priests, or militant Buddhist monks participating in genocide in Burma.

Intelligent, reasonable Muslim 'nyets might point out - the Qur'an is not merely a sacred text in the way that perhaps the Bible, the Torah, the Vedas, etc. are. The Qur'an is, to Muslims, the literal Words of God recorded perfectly by His Prophet - the sacredness of it to their religion means that burning a copy of the Qur'an fundamentally **is** an assault on their freedom of religion. As a point of comparison, I might share [the Piss Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ) - a piece of art I find highly distasteful, which places an image of my God in a jar of literal urine. But to a non-believer, that statue is just an image of plus-shaped bit of tree with a dying Jew nailed to it. I cannot compel them to believe what I believe - that is their Right. Equally, it is an imposition on the Rights of Belief of other people to impose your conception of what is and is not sacred onto them - you cannot force someone to agree with you. 

Freedom of speech fundamentally **must** mean the freedom to offend - if it does not, then it does not mean anything whatsoever. That is not to say in a civilised society, these types of actions should be encouraged or allowed to pass without comment - we should all of us be outraged and offended by this act of book-burning because it is clearly a dog-whistle to far-right extremism in Europe. And yet at the same time, fundamentally, the best stance to take against this type of cryptofascism is to stick to the values they despise - individual liberties, minority rights, and freedom from state interference. If something feels like it is too sensitive to speak about publicly, that is *precisely* the time when the Right to freedom of speech is important, and precisely at these difficult and uncomfortable points where it should be defended most strongly. 

It seems to me if you thought the previous govt shutting down the comedy clubs in TTDI was stupid overreach, you probably already understand most of this argument. Sorry for the essay, hope everyone has a nice weekend, happy to take questions/clarify anything in comments.",2023-01-27 13:23:11

It's quite silly to get worked up over symbolic rejections by other people.

My amateur observation:

PH has full control of most of the domestic policy making ministries, such as education, agriculture, sports, human resources and communications.

BN has full control of the foreign affairs.

Together with GPS, BN and GPS have control of the ""money making"" departments in plantations & commodities and works, as well as Zahid being given the rural development to allow him to rebuild UMNO's powerbase there.

A few crucial ministries are shared, such as finance, home affairs, defense, economy, transport and health. Though most of these, including finance, has PH ministers in the driving seat. Anwar even stuck in a DAP deputy finance minister to balance out the UMNO deputy finance minister.

Besides having the Sabah & Sarawak Affairs portfolio, the East Malaysian coalitions also get the tourism portfolio.

The other shared ministries seem to be just distribution of war spoils. So Warisan also gets a deputy minister as well there.",2022-12-10 00:42:29

Now, I'm not saying that ministers or deputy ministers must have relevant specialties prior to appointment. It is just a preference.

>In May 1997, Mahathir had appointed Anwar to be acting Prime Minister while he took a two-month holiday.\[24\] In Mahathir's absence, Anwar had independently taken radical steps, which directly conflicted with Mahathir's policies, to change the country's governing mechanisms. Issues such as how Malaysia would respond to a financial crisis were often at the forefront of this conflict. Towards the end of the 1990s, however, the relationship with Mahathir had begun to deteriorate, triggered by their conflicting views on governance.\[25\]\[26\]

>Anwar's frontal attack against what he described as the widespread culture of nepotism and cronyism within UMNO (and the ruling coalition as a whole) angered Mahathir, as did his attempts to dismantle the protectionist policies that Mahathir had set up.

comment,,37,ixq7a5q,,1669382187.0,"Unions are pretty good in Malaysia, depending on the sector. Most sectors are good, unions fight for bonuses and well-being of employees, and ensuring benefits. Unlike the US, we have a good union culture for lots of big corporations. You won't see thousands of layoffs like the US is seeing now in tech. Maybe in oil and gas, but only because the fluctuations mean that contracts are also less binding for most of their workers.

Not a lot of SMEs sign up for unions, so this generality does not apply to them, obviously.

And in the airline industry, we had the opposite problem in the US, where several of the unions were so powerful it really damaged the industry. Travel costs were rising in 2014-2015, so there was less travel, but the unions made it really hard to fire the cabin crew and pilots, so costs ramped up to the point that they had to dissolve the airline and name a new one so that the union doesn't apply to the new one.

Locality-based votes requires representative votes from local communities, which sentiments are limited to their own circle and that will make candidates think of detailed policies that will benefit each of these communities. Like our politician now have to entertain each race from different part of the states because each of their vote do matter. But ofc like you say, still open to gerrymandering and such.

Direct voting in the other hand give more fair decision where its all when the majority of people voice matter, but its all only in numbers, not representations. There's possibility of candidates only favoured to the majority or large communities and still got elected. Like any PM candidate could win if they only conquered the KL-Selangor and not anything else, because the region itself has 1/4 of the vote shares, esp when the candidature is an open one (more candidates, lesser potential vote threshold to pass). Smaller communities could be sidelined in determining this one.

In doing the direct majority one the would be some need for thresholds, be it in candidature or voting phase. Maybe need to get majority in minimum number of zones/states or whatever.",2022-11-02 04:36:25

But yet he has the majority support of the Chinese Malaysian is worrying me that they have not seen through his charades and die die must become PM mentality.

Racists ain't gonna vote for a liberal party ever, there's nothing you can do to make yourself more appealing to racists other than acting like one. They don't want a DAP government with many kafirs on it. Look at Anwar cabinet and a dozen of kafirs, that is EXACTLY what PN voters do NOT want.

PH has always been consistent with what it stands for, and unfortunately due to the outcome of the GE they had to form a unity government with coalitions that are willing to do so, PN on the other hand blatantly ignored the YDPA's decision and continued to peddle the rhetoric that they've won. 

I don't have an issue with people exercising their rights, I criticised their decision because it shows what they truly stand for, race and religion. PH can do nothing against decades of incessant fearmongering and brainwashing.

Instead of blaming PH, I could say the same to you and tell you to stop being idiots thinking groups that champion Malay supremacy or Islam is actually walking their talk. You won't go to heaven because you voted for PAS, nor do you think you benefit by keeping the status quo, but who am I to tell you how to think? I'm just a non who is being labelled as wanting to strip you off your privileges and enslave you. Sigh.

This is why the country is in this state, people only want to blame the other side and not look in the bloody mirror and see the true problem.",2022-12-11 12:53:25

No need to drop the Malay and religion stuff for now, no, just ensure that the basics are taken care of well and continuously improved. Things such as a clean water, electricity, good road works, farmer welfare, job opportunities, environment etc are all non-Malay or non-religious concerns, even in 'kafir nations' like China or Brazil.

Abandoning them is the reason why PN are sweeping the state like they own the place ‚Äî nobody is there to stop them. They can just easily make the excuse ""we can't help much because we're abandoned by the PH Unity government"".

There is a need to change the mindset of ""we should not help those who voted against us if they keep choosing the other side"", otherwise it will grow into resentment that is happily gobbled up and manipulated by PAS & whoever they choose to wed for their political ambition.

comment,,13,ize0o3d,,1670502831.0,"I know how some other researcher do it. Assuming she uses the same method, here's my guess of how she did it;

We know the demography of constituency are unbalanced, that is, some constituency would have an overwhelming number of malay voters and some would have an overwhelming number of chinese voters. If we for example, pick a malay majority constituency for instance, we can further zoom in on district with higher percentage of single race.

For instance, we know Bandar Tun Razak has 60% of Malay demography. However, if we zoom in on certain area, for instance pekan sungai besi, that area might have higher percentage of malay demography than that of other area of Bandar Tun Razak constituency (due to Kem Sungai Besi and there is higher percentage of malay in Army). 

If we further zoom in on specific polling station we might get a polling station in Pekan Sungai Besi area with very high density of malay voters. Maybe 80% of the registry. If we further zoom in on each specific saluran on this polling station we might get a monoculture demography. In other words, there is a specific saluran in specific polling station in specific constituency that is very close to 100% a single race. Suppose we know the result of election for this specifc saluran, we can then infer that's how specific ethnic in this constituency votes.

Of course this method is not foolproof. The researcher needs to account for age, for income level and various other variable to meaningfully deduce the data for general case. In other words, there are just too many variable to interpret Bridget data. However, that data should not be summarily dismissed either. There is something to it that PH should keep an eye on. Consider it as a very¬≥ rough estimate.

Here's a breakdown of Bridget data in numbers;

Voter turnout (15.5 million)

malaysia demography/ Bumi : Chinese : Indian : Others
(62.5% : 20.6% : 6.8% : 10.1%)

PN 

Malay (54%) = 54% X 62.5% X 15.5 Million = 5.2 million
Others (5%) = 78k

PH

Malay (11%) = 1.07 million

Chinese (94%) = 3.0 million

Indian (83%) = 875k

Others (66%) = 1.03 million

BN

Malay (33%) = 3.20 million

Chinese (5%) = 160k

Indian (16%) = 169k

Others (27%) = 423k

Furthermore, of the voter turnout, an estimated 75% of undi 18 turned out to vote. Which is roughly 4.35 million voters (est. 2.72 million malay). 

Whilst people has been shitting on undi 18 for supposedly swaying to PN, I don't think it was an open and shut case. I don't think undi 18 votes for PN for religious or racial reason. Similarly, not all 54% of voter voting for PN for racial or religious reason. PN knew this well. Using dark blue for their party color may have been a calculated measures. 

All in all, it is too hasty to accept Bridget data as true but equally perfunctory to reject it.",2022-12-08 20:33:51
comment,,7,izdzfry,,1670502035.0,"""How do you find out the percentage of people of a certain race/religion that voted for a certain party?""

Back-calculate and a bit of optimisation. If you have the dataset of the racial percentages of all seats and turnout of all seats, if you then assume an average support level for each race and each party nationwide, you can get estimated votes each party gains per seat. Then it's just a matter of optimising to get accurate average support rate for each race. You can of course scale this to be more refined (with individual voting districts), or more coarse (by general aggregate for state or peninsular).",2022-12-08 20:20:35

comment,,27,ize6d87,,1670506147.0,"""Not one out-Malay UMNO or Bersatu.""

When Malayness is now defined as Islam, those who control Islam controls Malayness. PAS is now pushing to be the champion of Islam, by default the champion of Malayness. You just need to see how much has the original (non religious) concept of ""Malayness"" has eroded in the East coast (and now increasingly Kedah). UMNO realised their mistake too late when they played with the religious fire, Bersatu is more than happy to double down on it.

Bersatu will replace UMNO, but with a far more Malay/Islamic centric agenda, and one that is wedded to PAS, like how PKR and DAP are inseparable. If demographic changes and political realities remain, I expect UMNO to be extinct, PH to always be getting 40% of the vote, and Bersatu+PAS to consistently get 55% of votes and majority of seats (if you tally up all votes for UMNO/BN, Bersatu, PAS for every election since 2013, you'll get roughly 55%, that is the Malay-centric demographic vote). In that scenario, the kings will make a deal with Bersatu to ensure their survival (but it'll be short lived, PAS/Bersatu might just cut the fat to get a larger share of the pie, especially if PAS becomes the main Islamic champion). The recent conflicts PAS launched against the kings on Islamic matters (bon Odori comes to mind) are deeply concerning.

To the eyes of Malay nationalists, Amanah is viewed as DAPs dog, and PKR is out to remove their privileges, both parties are dead in their eyes. Only people vying for their support are UMNO and PN.

Party elections for Bersatu won't change a thing, they'll still be wedded to PAS. Party elections for UMNO, yes, that will decide the future. All of what I've said is merely a trajectory if things stay constant. Only UMNO has the power to reverse their decades of religious and racial shit stirring and push for a middle ground, grab votes from that 55% demographic.",2022-12-08 21:29:07

I agree with Islam and Malay are a close knit relationship but PAS will not represent the Malay as long Bersatu and UMNO exist.

> I expect UMNO to be extinct

No, disagree as imo the next pemilihan will change the politic landscape. The current iteration of UMNO will disappear as early of next year. UMNO top 5 most likely to change. If you see those who are in the government rn, were not part of the PN BN GPS government except for Azalina who held some position (Tengku Zafrul is an outsider) while the UMNO MKT is still pushing their agenda for the death of Bersatu. 

> Party elections for Bersatu won't change a thing, they'll still be wedded to PAS. Party elections for UMNO, yes, that will decide the future.

The current Deputy of Bersatu is Peja who'd lost to PM10. Muhyiddin is 75 years old, anyone who can win the Deputy most likely to succeed Bersatu. 
The Vice of Bersatu are Radzi Jidin, Azmin, and Ronald Kiandee. The will be changes as well and 5 years are long time in politics.",2022-12-08 22:41:48

This varies state to state greatly. North (Kedah, Kelantan, Tgganu) is basically Islam = Malay, and PAS are the gatekeepers. The kings of Perak, Pahang, Sgor and Johor all know it's coming for them next, and they're taking major active steps to prevent it. How successful they will be, we'll see. For real this is a bigger existential crisis for them, as it is for nons.

UMNO will have their elections, hard to say yet who will win. If UMNO decides to join Bersatu, before next GE Bersatu will cut UMNO out and join with PAS to finish off UMNO. Or Bersatu absorbs UMNO, which is a more interesting and unpredictable scenario. If UMNO remains with PH, then it's entirely up to them in maintaining status quo for next GE and beyond.

I agree 5 years is a long time, but at this stage Bersatu compliments PAS far too well and vice versa. Both have a Malay Islam supremacy rhetoric, both dislike the monarchy, one gives religious clout, the other administration clout, and both wants UMNO dead. The only time if they split is if one party thinks it can govern without the other, which based on our demographic numbers is not possible. Both need each other, and will be wedded for as long as one can see.",2022-12-09 01:11:22

But let's try to see this from Amazon eye.

We have the second best internet infrastructure in the region behind Singapore. 

We have one of the lower wages in the region and MYR is not rising anytime soon. 

For better or worse. We have one of the most educated population in the region, and to get better workers u would have to go for Singapore where land and wages are expensive.

Our electric are... Again very stable in the sense that others are worse than us. And water supply are plenty (servers complex use LOTS of water cooling)

And our geographic means that we are always in near centre of the region where it's a important with internet stability. (By that I mean the most developed region is at the centre of SEA. Where Indonesia capital is further and Singapor and Brunei being veryyy expensive)

comment,,13,jb96cvi,,1678186997.0,"Okay lar here goes the numbers

### Rates

[China (Shanghai) Rate](http://sh.sina.com.cn/news/z/jietidianjia/) - (0.677rmb (peak rate) + 0.337rmb (off-peak rate))/2 = 0.507 rmb (average rate) = RM 0.33 per kwh

[Malaysia TNB Industrial E1 Rate](https://www.tnb.com.my/commercial-industrial/pricing-tariffs1/) - RM 0.337 per kwh

[US New York Rate](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/data/averageenergyprices_selectedareas_table.htm) - U$ 0.243 per kwh = RM 1.09 per kwh

[Singapore Rate](https://www.spgroup.com.sg/sp-services/overview-of-services) - 0.3127 sgd per kwh = RM 1.04 per kwh

### Annual Electricity Cost

One high tier datacenter [consumes about 850 megawatt of electricity](https://www.racksolutions.com/news/blog/how-many-servers-does-a-data-center-have/). That is (850 x 1000 x 24 x 30 x 12) = 7,344,000,000 kwh of electricity per year.

China - 7,344,000,000 x RM 0.33 = RM 2,423,520,000 = RM 2.4 billion per year

Malaysia - 7,344,000,000 x RM 0.337 = RM 2,474,928,000 = RM 2.4 billion per year

US NYC - 7,344,000,000 x RM 1.09 = RM 8,004,960,000 = RM 8.0 billion per year

Singapore - 7,344,000,000 x RM 1.04 = RM 7,637,760,000 = RM 7.6 billion per year

### Takeaway

To answer your question. The running cost is around the same comparing Malaysia with China, but considering geopolitical factors and higher wages in China, Malaysia is easily a better choice.

For comparing against US/Singapore, well I guess the numbers speak for themselves, savings of RM 5.0 bill per year is quite a lot. Not to mention our wages are also lower as well. üòÖ",2023-03-07 19:03:17

comment,,22,jb94yu1,,1678185845.0,"Don't give the typical reddit reply where you are complaining about a problem without understanding **why** things are the way it is and **why** it is very difficult to solve. I'll just give an example:

Malaysia and Singapore have an engineering firm. Both engineering firms have a revenue of 1 million in each of their currency. Singapore's currency is 3x of Malaysia's.

Regardless of how you do, unless you pay your engineers 3 times the amount a Singaporean company pay theirs (in their own currency respectively). The reality is that a developed nation will **always** be ""better"".

Sure you can pay your workers ""competitively"" to retain workers from moving to a developed nation. But can your business grow then? The money come from where? Your business revenue is still from local which they sure aren't going to buy your products and services that is 3x more expensive now, because why the fuck should I do that when I can buy actual overseas product if I'm going to pay for overseas prices?

[Tragic reality of brain drain in poor countries](https://youtu.be/YYvLEbC3kn8)

Money doesn't drop from sky.

**Edit**: A more relevant example. Local engineering firm like Proton can probably pay a lot more money to retain engineers from going overseas. 

But doing so, if they want to stay profitable, they will need to increase the price of their car. But then if a Proton will now cost the same as BMW, will you buy a Proton or BMW? Certainly paying their engineers more will not magically make Proton's car quality as good or better than BMW.

How about their export market also, will importers of Proton buy Proton anymore now that its priced the same as BMW? Why not they buy BMW instead?

Its a very complicated problem that economist don't have a solution to. Let alone redditors like you and I. So try to understand what's going on before complaining.",2023-03-07 18:44:05

I'm no expert but she seems like a fucking corrupt bitch.

She is famous for proposing, when she was in charge of the Ministry of Corrupting Youth and Corrupting Sports, that Malaysia, build a sports center, **IN LONDON!** for RM490 million. Do you want to guess how much of that she wanted to songlap?

Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Azalina Othman said in Parliament yesterday that it had identified the Tun Abdul Razak Research Centre in Brickendonbury, England, as the site for the future high performance sports training centre.

In a written reply to a question from the DAP MP for Ipoh Timur, Lim Kit Siang, she said the sports complex would act as a short-term training centre and a ""forward base"" for national athletes who would compete in European tournaments.

She said apart from helping Malaysian athletes acclimatise to the weather, it would enable sports officials to have access to the expertise and technology of countries more advanced in sports.

""The Tun Abdul Razak Research Centre was chosen not only because it is in London, which is the gateway to other European countries, but also because it is located on government-owned land,"" she said.",2022-12-03 21:32:25

The British told them all to go get fucked. Luckily. No doubt, we already burnt few million pounds on consultants to get that answer.

Malaysia‚Äôs application to turn the Tun Abdul Razak Research Centre in Brickendonbury, England, into a High Performance Training Centre (HPTC) for sports has been rejected. 

The East Herts Council Development Control Committee voted on Wednesday night against the proposal made by the National Sports Institute (NSI). 

In a press statement yesterday, the NSI director-general Datuk Dr Ramlan Abdul Aziz, who was present at the hearing, said: ‚ÄúWe are disappointed. 

‚ÄúWe now have to prepare a report to be submitted to the Cabinet Committee for Sports (headed by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak) for their guidance on the next course of action.",2022-12-04 00:36:34

I understand that for someone who‚Äôs still fresh out of secondary school, politics probably wasn‚Äôt on your list things to learn until very recently. On the internet, I know you‚Äôve also probably read at least a hundred reasons to go out to vote, and you‚Äôve also been shouted left and right by many as if the world is ending if you don‚Äôt vote. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not that you don‚Äôt care; you‚Äôre probably just feeling annoyed, intimidated or confused by how much you‚Äôre expected to act like an adult when you know very little about the world!

As an educator, I just wanted help you out: I have summarised all the different political coalition parties below in a way that you might easily understand. In this write-up I will give you the pros and cons of voting for each coalition, so that you can better understand how to be part of the change Malaysia needs. You don‚Äôt need to read through everything; just jump to the parts that are relevant to you.

# BARISAN NASIONAL (BN)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vf9xxu0kncy91.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9bc6bec023e47d6819b42835159e019982878dd7

**Intro**: BN was fundamentally built by three parties: the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), representing the three major races in Malaysia. BN was formed long before you were born (used to be called ‚ÄòParti Perikatan‚Äô in the early years), and most of the prime ministers you learned about (Tunku, Razak, Hussein Onn, Mahathir, Abdullah, Najib) were all from BN. BN has been governing Malaysia since its formation, until the last election where the Malaysian people decided to vote them out (mainly due to Najib swindling billions of ringgit for himself).

**Why people vote for BN**: BN has led our government for 61 years, so they are rather familiar with the ways of governing a country, which is rather complex because it involves finances, businesses and empowering the society, finding a balance between all these things are no easy task. People who vote for BN are those who don‚Äôt want big changes: they like how the things are going at the moment, they want peacefulness and stability, and are comfortable with how Malaysia is heading to. BN is also the only coalition that that has race-based parties represented by the 3 main race groups in Malaysia, so this is favourable to the generation of people who are more comfortable with race-based politics. It has been shown that people from rural areas (not in the city) generally vote for BN, because the village folks get a lot of help from BN in the past, while other coalitions have not really had the finances and means to bridge long term relationships with these people.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for BN**: You should know that the top leadership of BN, people like Najib Razak and Ahmad Zahid Hamidi are accused of a lot of corruption charges, meaning that they have abused their power to earn money that wasn‚Äôt supposed to belong to them. Voting for them implies a support for corrupted leaders to continue to lead the country! When a political coalition is in power, they have the means of overwriting court decisions, so this means that there is a chance that Najib may be released from prison, and Zahid's charges may be dropped, allowing both of them to be free. From many people‚Äôs guesses, Zahid made the election happen now (despite of warnings of floods and rain) because he wants to get back in power and be released from all the charges from the court. In terms of MCA and MIC, their support from the Chinese and Indians have dwindled because generally they have not done anything significant for their communities, so voting for them implies no major changes in the quality of life, and the continuation of UMNO-dominated politics and policies.

# PAKATAN HARAPAN (PH)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uviy7kzoncy91.png?width=270&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2be111935a7af98f6675d4d10f7cca7aab47a0ad

**Intro:** PH was formed in 2015, it mainly consists of the People‚Äôs Justice Party (PKR), the Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Party Amanah Negara (or just AMANAH). This coalition is not new actually, these parties were political alliances in the past under different names (Pakatan Rakyat in 2008, Barisan Alternatif in 1998), they are seen as the main opposition parties to BN for a long time. DAP was founded by former members of the Singaporean People‚Äôs Action Party (PAP) in 1965 (after Singapore got independent), many prominent leaders in DAP were Chinese and Indians, so it gave the public impression that they are more non-bumi-centric and also Singapore-looking. PKR was formed in 1998 by Anwar‚Äôs wife Wan Azizah, after a series of events that led to the sacking of Anwar by Mahathir, the then prime minister. AMANAH on the other hand was actually a redefinition of an existing party (Malaysia Workers‚Äô Party), but they are better known as a party that broke off from the Islam-centric Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) in 2015. Basically what happened was that PAS and DAP couldn‚Äôt see things eye to eye, so PAS left Pakatan Rakyat, while those former PAS members who still wanted to be in Pakatan Rakyat came out and formed AMANAH. PH briefly came into power in 2018, but they lost power in 2020 due to the betrayal of some politicians during what was called the ‚ÄòLangkah Sheraton‚Äô.

**Why people vote for PH**: People who vote for PH generally sees them as a chance for change, hoping that Malaysia would step out of its old system, its race-based politics and policies, and hope that Malaysia would move forward with more competent governance and ministers. The quality of politicians in PH are also higher in general, many of them have graduated from reputable universities around the world, and many PH ministers have actually made some significant changes during their rule. PH is also popular among the non-Malays because PH seemed like the only coalition that has significant non-Malay representation, unlike other Malay-centric coalitions like BN and those to be discussed below. Actually the bulk of the PH supporters are not really crazy about PH, instead PH just seemed like the lesser evil of all other coalitions in this list.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for PH**: PH suffers from the fact that the party leader Anwar has quite a controversial background (he was alleged to be involved in some gay sex stuff, he seemed to be desperate to be prime minister, keep saying he has the numbers to form government but doesn‚Äôt, etc), so the more religious people don‚Äôt like him as a leader. DAP is also known to conservative Malay-Muslims as ""communist"" and ""anti-Islam"" because DAP is more vocal on issues concerning non-Malay rights. AMANAH on the other hand is not seen as a very prominent party: they are known to be a more progressive Islamic party, which doesn‚Äôt sit well with the more conservative PAS supporters. Many have also thought that ""life has not really changed since PH took over"", and ""PH had too many infighting among themselves"", so they lose support from these people.

# PERIKATAN NASIONAL (PN)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vdtuf5erncy91.png?width=285&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b253dbb15dc4f0a203dc40ef74520218fb2ae35

**Intro**: PN was formed in 2020 after Langkah Sheraton, they mainly consist of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU), Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (or just GERAKAN) and some other Sabah-centric parties. PAS is the oldest of them all, it was formed in 1945 and is the strongest Islam-centric party in Malaysia. GERAKAN was formed in 1968, it started as an alternative to MCA, but later became part of BN for many years; they are generally seen as a Chinese-dominant party that that ruled in Penang for many years. BERSATU was formed in 2016 by Muhyiddin Yassin after Najib Razak sacked him from his deputy prime minister position (he spoke out against Najib‚Äôs controversy), they are Malay-centric, seen as the ‚Äòcleaner UMNO‚Äô to many, but also seen as the ‚Äòtraitor party‚Äô that led to the fall of the Pakatan Harapan government. PN was the government that was leading Malaysia since the pandemic began.

**Why people vote for PN**: As BERSATU is the main driver in this coalition, generally Malays who don‚Äôt want the corrupt UMNO but yet don‚Äôt want DAP find this as the best option. PN is mainly Malay and Muslim centric, so the more conservative and religious Malays like this option too. PN has also led Malaysia out of the pandemic, though without its problems, they generally didn‚Äôt destroy the country, so to many they seem a rather ok coalition to move the country forward.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for PN**: As mentioned, PN is a very Malay-Muslim centric coalition, so far we have not heard of any significant policies beneficial towards non-Malays, so they have very little support from the Chinese and Indians. With PAS in the coalition, some non-Muslims are concerned that PAS may advocate for stronger and harsher Islamic rules to be implemented in the country (e.g. closing cinemas, hudud laws), so this scares away many as well. Although GERAKAN is there representing the non-Malays, they generally gain a rather weak support from them, since they haven‚Äôt really done any significant good thing in quite a while.

# GERAKAN TANAH AIR (GTA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u2rge6z2pcy91.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=115c64ad7a397a06b255c3f19c24c4c4423c7937

**Intro**: GTA was formed just recently by Mahathir Mohamad, and it mainly consists of Parti Pejuang Tanah Air (PEJUANG), Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (formerly known as PERKASA, now known as PUTRA) and a few lesser known political parties. PUTRA was formed in 2018 by Ibrahim Ali, and was generally seen as quite an extreme Malay-centric party. PEJUANG was formed in 2020 by Mahathir after he was kicked out from BERSATU (after Langkah Sheraton), and it is a Malay-centric party similar to BERSATU and UMNO. GTA‚Äôs purpose isn‚Äôt really clear, but to the public it just seems to be there to fight against BN.

**Why people vote for GTA**: GTA has Mahathir as its leader, which is good news to Mahathir fans. It is undoubted that Mahathir has done many good things for Malaysia in the past, so some are still believers that he will be able to save the country from the current mess.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for GTA**: Mahathir is already 97 years old, many feel that he should just retire and not continue to lead a country. Some PH supporters also say that it is his fault that PH fell apart, so they see this coalition as a ‚Äòtraitor‚Äô to the country as well. Other weaknesses of GTA include the fact that they are there to dilute BN, PN and PH votes; the other parties relatively unknown; they are not strong enough to form a government on their own; the controversial Ibrahim Ali (‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk SHTI!‚Äù); and they do not have any non-Muslim representation.

# MALAYSIAN UNITED DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE (MUDA)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/07rgagf6ocy91.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f75ac7dca996187e86e8fe229f8e28e7a3747f77

**Intro**: MUDA is a youth-centric party formed by Syed Saddiq in 2020, after he was kicked-out by BERSATU. Generally MUDA is still very new, so their impact in the Malaysian political arena is still yet to be seen.

**Why people vote for MUDA**: MUDA is the only youth-centric party, so voting for them implies a support for more younger generation involvement in politics. MUDA is also currently a coalition partner of PH, so a support for MUDA will be a support for PH.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for MUDA**: MUDA is a relatively young party, with a younger demographic as their leadership means that they lack the experience of other political parties in terms of decision making, resources, connections and planning. That is probably what led to the scandal of Syed Saddiq on the misappropriation of funds.

# PARTI WARISAN (WARISAN)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qztyj8z9ocy91.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae1416084f9db6ffa08d4e607ff43d4147efb068

**Intro:** WARISAN was formed by Shafie Apdal in 2016, after Najib has removed him from his cabinet (he probably voiced out against Najib‚Äôs corruption at that time, just like Muhyiddin). WARISAN was formerly a Sabah-centric party and an ally to PH, but in the current election they have decided to run solo and also expanded their reach to West Malaysia as well. At this point, WARISAN‚Äôs presence in West Malaysia is generally side-lined by the big battle between BN vs PN vs PH.

**Why people vote for WARISAN**: WARISAN used to be a coalition partner of PH, so they have similar values to PH, therefore acting as a good alternative to PH. They are also a good alternative against Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) in terms of a Sabah-centric party selection. Some WARISAN voters are just supporters of Shafie Apdal.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for WARISAN**: WARISAN is currently not a coalition partner of PH, which means that they may just end up diluting the votes against the big battle between BN, PN and PH, so this is not a good option for those who are focused on ousting BN/PN/PH. WARISAN is also currently not big enough to make a difference in West Malaysia, and it is also unsure who do they side with in the end. For Sabah voters, WARISAN was also blamed for having a state election that caused another covid-19 wave in 2020.

# GABUNGAN PARTI SARAWAK (GPS)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2qxqtdbkocy91.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1bd3478ce50f52b0ae06ea20fe701af750b3fea5

**Intro:** GPS was formed in 2018 after Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS), Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) and Sarawak United People‚Äôs Party (SUPP) left BN. Essentially they are just the same people governing Sarawak since the past, just that they are no longer under BN. GPS focuses on Sarawak‚Äôs state interests and rights based on the Malaysia Agreement.

**Why people vote for GPS**: the people who vote for GPS are those who don‚Äôt see any big problem with their governance; and since they are now no longer under BN, they can be more vocal against any discrimination against Sarawak, so this attracts fellow native Sarawakians as well.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for GPS**: Supporting GPS may imply supporting BN or PN, because they were coalition partners with them previously, and may continue to do so. So voters who prefer PH to be the central government will vote against them instead, at least for the national elections. Some also say that the current Sarawak government is corrupted, and would like to see a new government for a change.

# GABUNGAN RAKYAT SABAH (GRS)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8jkaauynocy91.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d60feefb16a1d2449dcf7e4a99a3e86c4dcc42f4

**Intro**: GRS was officially registered in 2022, it is a coalition between BERSATU Sabah, Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), Parti Solidariti Tanah Airku (STAR) and United Sabah National Organisation (USNO); it is also allied by other BN and PN parties as well. This is an interesting coalition as it does not seem to follow the coalition rules of West Malaysia and is doing its own thing. But generally, GRS acts as the main competitors of PH and GTA in Sabah.

**Why people vote for GRS**: Similar to GPS, GRS is state-centric, so they are more inward looking towards issues that will benefit the Sabah people as a whole. GRS is also made up of the usual people governing Sabah in the past, so voting for GRS means stability and not expecting radical changes.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for GRS**: Similar to GPS, GRS was also coalition partners with BN or PN, in fact a mix of both, so voting for GRS implies supporting BN or PN on a national level. So those who do not want BN or PN to govern the country will definitely vote against GRS, at least on a national level.

# INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES

**Intro:** these are just people who are not affiliated to any political party and would like to run for election. Some of them were formerly from a certain political party, but decided to run as an independent after not being given a seat by their party leaders.

**Why people vote for independent candidates**: some of these candidates are just well-known among the locals, might be some important figure in the business or education arena in their district, so they are supported for that. Some voters of independent candidates are people who believe that you should vote for the person, and not the party.

**Why people don‚Äôt vote for independent candidates**: independent candidates can ~~enter~~ support literally any party after they got elected, so voting for them may result in unexpected results. Independent candidates also dilute the votes of the big BN vs PN vs PH battle, so people who don‚Äôt vote for them usually have nothing against them, they just want to focus on ousting a certain party / supporting a certain party for the government.

# CLOSING REMARKS

There are actually plenty of resources online that you can find on the good and bad of each parties, so please feel free to read through them. If you need to talk to someone about it, you can always start with a discussion with your parents, your cousins or friends. But always remember that most political discussions can be biased, emotional and subjective, so read every piece of analysis with a pinch of salt, and always cross-check with the evidence.

Happy voting, and I wish you all the best! :)

**Acknowledgement**: thanks to u/DerpyPoint for pointing out that the anti hopping law in place now does not allow even independent candidates to join another party after the election, although they could still ally with any party, so it still gives rise to unexpected results.",2022-11-06 23:45:19
comment,,30,ivaz618,,1667755089.0,"Good write-up OP.

**For those of you folks in Sarawak: there's also the PSB/PBK alliance**. Both are Sarawak-based regionalist parties founded within the last 5-10 years. 

In last December's Sarawak state election, where GPS won in a landslide, PSB (Parti Sarawak Bersatu) actually won the second most votes after GPS, and twice more votes and seats than PH (4 seats to 2 PH seats). Parti Bumi Kenyalang is not far behind PH in vote share.

PSB and PBK combined would have 24% of the vote, though this is before Undi18 has come into effect, so they're a wild card.

**Reason why people would vote for PSB/PBK**: Would be similar to why they vote for other regionalist parties. They are seen as not being tainted by West Malaysian politics and more focused on Sarawak. They also have the advantage of being perceived as not being associated with the skeletons that GPS has during their time with BN. So people who don't want to support PH but also don't like GPS might be attracted by PSB/PBK.

**Reason why people won't vote PSB/PBK:** Not enough experience. Too much of a wild card. Same reason like why people don't want to vote independent candidates - not wanting to dilute the vote in the GPS vs PH fight (BN and PN basically do not exist in Sarawak).",2022-11-07 01:18:09

comment,,8,ivdza3s,,1667804638.0,"Hey OP, appreciate the write up, I got some additional info for MUDA which you may add in. Referencing Syed Saddiq's podcast with Jinnyboy, MUDA does not only mean young in terms of age, but MUDA is also defined as having a ""disrupter's mindset"", meaning to go against the grain of what is generally accepted/normal in Malaysian society. 

Examples would be to be outspoken on issues when the culture is more submissive, to dare to continue to push in what they believe in (Syed's example was UNDI18 where everyone said it won't come to fruition cause of this and that but he continued to push for it) and stuff like that.

comment,,32,ivbiihn,,1667762523.0,"I would add another factor that people don't vote for PH is that prior to the GE14, PH has successfully cultivated an image that portrays them as a competent coalition that could govern better than BN ever did. But that image has since been shattered during their 22 months in office. You can see from the recent poll that PH at one point only had a 25% approval rating. And you can see people no longer refer to PH as a force of good anymore either, they're now the lesser evil. A lot of people got disillusioned.",2022-11-07 03:22:03

comment,,5,iverdd2,,1667826629.0,"Thank you for the informative summary. I know it is unreasonable to expect an internet post to cover everything, but I wonder if the omission of policies/ manifestos in this post is intentional because it truly reflects how usual voters do not put much emphasis on it.

For example my biggest gripes about PH is because of their economic policies. Pro fuel subsidy and repealed GST. And now daring to promise free tolls again after explaining why they cannot do it last time. 

PH makes a big fuss about the national debt but actually that debt increased during their era because they repealed GST amongst other policies.

Why is it that a corrupt coalition like BN is able to consistently push out saner economic policies than the allegedly anti corruption PH?",2022-11-07 21:10:29

I mean if you are nons you can either vote PH/Muda or the other coalitions which are all malay supremacist and treat you as 2nd class citizen. If you wanna be 2nd class citizen forever go ahead.

For me it's actually really simple. It doesn't matter how much contribution a BN/PN candidate does or plan to do because at the end of the day they openly represent parties that stand for malay supremacy. Personally I don't support racism, end of.

Considering to vote for BN/PN is not much difference than considering to vote for white supremacist party, even if some of their candidate might be competent it is not something I will consider.",2022-11-07 04:05:15

For more details on how to register for postal voting, refer to this [link here]

[link here]: http://sprinfo.spr.gov.my/spr/UNDI%20POS%20PRU%2015/6.%20POSTAL%20VOTE%20ONLINE%20APPLICATION%20GUIDE%20(CATEGORY%201B)%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf>

### What's the voting procedure going to be like?

> A voter can make only one vote for each type in an election. After identity verification at a voting centre, on the left hand, an indelible link is put which lasts its impression for a week. This is to make sure that voters do not vote again in the same election. The officials tick off the name of the voter on the electoral list and the voter will then be given the ballot papers. Each voter receives two paper ballots, one for the parliamentary seat of the constituency and another for the state assembly seat. In federal territories, where there is no state assembly, and states whose state election is held on a different date, each voter receives only one ballot for the parliamentary seat.

> Each voter walks into an individual booth to mark ballots while maintaining confidentiality. The voter marks on each ballot the candidate of his or her choice with a cross beside the candidate‚Äôs name and party symbol. 
After completing, the voter folds the ballots and drops them into separate ballot boxes for parliamentary and state assembly seats.

> The whole process will be observed by election officials and agents of candidates and parties. 

- excerpt from GlobalBersih.org

###What should I bring on election day?

Your national identification card (MyKad) would suffice. Stationeries will be provided at the polling station for you to mark your ballots. No, you can't use your own pencil.

### How should I mark my ballot paper properly?

The ideal way is to mark X next to the candidate of your choice. However, marking X is not the only acceptable way. [Click here for details on valid ballots from SPR in 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12coCmzZnh_krpIhtxPtVJLy_Nw96_bfJ/view)

### My current voting area is different from my current IC address, would that be ok?

As it stands all address updates must be done prior to the most recent gazetted voter roll. SPR last updated the voter roll this August, gazetted in Sept. Be prepared to travel home if you have not done so - courtesy of /u/jamescaleb

### I would like to update my voting district to my current address, what should I do?

You would need to make an application to SPR to change your voting district as it is not done automatically. You have 3 ways to do this:- 

1. Apply for voting district change in SPR headquarters or one of its state branches

2. Change it at your local POS Malaysia branches, bring your IC along.

3. Update online through https://myspr.spr.gov.my, click **Borang A**, and fill up the form.

## Political Coalition Info

Malaysia's parliament is composed of a total of 222 seats spread across all 13 states and 3 federal territories. All 222 parliament seats will be up for contest as political parties vie for supremacy in the upcoming 15th General Election. The election will be conducted through a first-past-the-post voting system. Therefore it is common for political parties to form alliances to avoid the spoiler effect that might occur in a multi-cornered contest. State elections are commonly held in concurrent with the federal election but this election would be the exception. There is currently no local government election in Malaysia. Here are some major political coalitions to familiarise yourself with for the upcoming election.

comment,,7,is1zaf2,,1665600254.0,"Oh boii, let me refresh my high school history lesson for a while. Anyway, here goes nothing.

Malaysia is defined by the constitution as a federation whereby each state has retained considerable autonomy from the federal government (though whether this is the actual case in Malaysia is up for debate). There are three levels of government in Malaysia which will be explained in detail as follows:-

## Top level: Federal Government

The federal government is the highest level of government in Malaysia. The legislative branch here is known as Parliament and is led by the Prime Minister. The MP that you choose in the election will also sit at this level as part of the federal legislative branch. The federal government is responsible for policies and laws that would affect the entire country. These are areas that are under the federal government's jurisdiction:-

- Foreign policy

- National defense

- Law enforcement

- Judiciary

- Citizenship

- National finance and taxation

- Public transportation

- Education

- Healthcare 

## Mid-level: State government

The state government is the middle level of government in Malaysia. The legislative branch here is known as the State Assembly(DUN) and is led by the Chief Minister (Menteri Besar). The ADUN that you choose in the election will sit at this level as part of the state legislative branch. The state government is responsible for policies and laws that would affect the state that is not under the authority of the federal government. These are areas that are under the state government's jurisdiction:-

- Land matters 

- Public works 

- Local government 

- Agriculture and forestry 

- Islamic law 

- Public holidays

##Lowest level: Local government

The local government is the lowest level of government in Malaysia. The legislative branch here is known as the Municipal/City Council (Dewan/Majlis Bandaraya) and is led by the Mayor (Datuk Bandar). The legislator at this level is known as local councilors and they are not elected through election but appointed by the state government (very undemocratic I know). These are areas that are under the state government's jurisdiction:-

- grant licenses and permits for businesses

- basic amenities

- waste management

- planning development for land-use and infrastructure (horrible pedestrian walkway? blame them)

As you can see, each level of government has different responsibilities and voters might prefer different political party than what they chose at the federal level This is why we get to vote twice. One for the federal level, the other one for the state level(which also by extension the local level).",2022-10-13 02:44:14

post,Indonesia and Malaysia: Javanese vs Malays,184,114cdr1,16,1676614319.0,"# INTRODUCTION

I did a post about [ethnicity in Indonesia and the Philippines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rp8qex/how_indonesia_and_the_philippines_define_and/), and someone said I should do one for Indonesia and Malaysia.  This post will be different from the one comparing ethnicity in Indonesia and the Philippines because I will focus on comparing the two main ethnicities of each country, Malays for Malaysia, and Javanese for Indonesia.

In terms of identity, Javanese and Malays are very different.  Javanese base identity on blood, while for Malays it is cultural. Javanese are introverted and visual, and Malays are extroverted and oral. In the religious and cultural sphere, Malays are more accepting of foreign influences, they modify their old practices to adapt to new ones. On the other hand, Javanese tend to be more syncretic, blending foreign influences with their own culture, be it Hindu-Buddhism or Islam. In contrast, in the political realm, the opposite is true. Malays are conservative politically, preferring gradual evolution and stability, while Javanese political change is more radical and violent. Ironically, this leads to Malays continuously pushing forward while Javanese, in times of crisis, look back to the past.

# IDENTITY

Javanese like most other ethnic groups in Indonesia base their identity on blood. The same could be said of Minang, Batak, etc. Malays are the exception, as they have a cultural identity of what constitutes Malay. This originates in the [Malacca Sultanate:](https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/The-advent-of-Islam)

>The mostly Islamicized people of 15th-century Malacca began calling themselves ‚ÄúMalays‚Äù (‚ÄúMelayu‚Äù), likely a reference to their Sumatran origins. Thereafter the term Malay was applied to those who practiced Islam and spoke a version of the Malay language. Religious and linguistic behavior, rather than descent, then, became the criteria for being Malay; this enabled previously Hindu-Buddhist peoples and former adherents of local religions to identify themselves (and even merge) with the Malays‚Äîregardless of their ancestry.ys were orthodox Muslims.

**STEREOTYPICAL OCCUPATIONS**

Historically, the Javanese are known as farmers and craftsmen, while the Malays were traders and fishermen. This stereotype dates back to the 8th and 9th centuries when Sriwijaya dominated trade routes and the Javanese kingdoms relied on their fertile volcanic soil and a large population to serve as the rice bowl of Nusantara. Even today, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese are still known for their crafting skills. Jokowi's background as a furniture maker is a stereotypical Javanese occupation.

**INTROVERT VS EXTROVERT**

Javanese are introverted, while Malays are extrovert.  While there are exceptions like Sukarno, generally Javanese are more reserved. Malays talk a lot and they like making threats, but often it's just talk. While you hear other Indonesian leaders like Jusuf Kalla make similar statements, Javanese leaders tend to be more measured.

Secondly, Javanese are visual, while Malays are oral.  Malay politicians like Anwar or Mahathir are very good at wordplay and using words to their advantage.   Javanese like to express themselves through pictures and symbols.

# RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL WORLDVIEW

The Javanese worldview is Dharmic-Abrahamic, while most other predominately Muslim ethnic groups in Maritime Southeast Asia like the Malays have an Islamic worldview.

While Malays are united by Islam, the Javanese are united by Kejawen  Kejawen is the belief-philosophical system followed by almost all Javanese on top of their religion.  It incorporates traditional beliefs, Hindu-Buddhism, and Islam into a belief-philosophical system.  You can be Christan, Muslim, and Buddhist and still follow Kejawen.  However, there are Javanese who only follow Kejawen.

To understand how the Javanese view religion, academics reference court poets of 18-19th centuries.  In[ Serat Cabolek, supposedly written by Raden Ngabehi Yasadipura I, the famous Surakarta court poet of the 18th century, tries to reconcile Sharia and Javanese beliefs](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4405/2aae273da01612a0d087a96bded7398992eb.pdf)

>The Shari‚Äôa as a container, not as the contents of the spiritual life. Shari‚Äôa is essential as a guide that is central to human outward life, but more important is the spiritual content. The ultimate goal of the human spiritual life is to know ‚Äòfrom where‚Äô and ‚Äòwhere‚Äô life is. In other words, it is to know himself that in reality is a manifestation of God. For Yasadipura I the greatest contribution to humanity in the quest for life perfectness, namely: the teachings of Dewa Ruci. It provides answers to the problem of ‚Äòfrom where‚Äô and ‚Äòwhere‚Äô of human existence. From the perspective of Javanese tradition, the change of the container by declaring itself a Muslim who upholds that the Shariah creates no obstacles. Provided that the person maintains his Javanese belief in his efforts to achieve ma‚Äôrifat, which in Javanese is called ‚Äúpamoring kawula Gusti‚Äù (unity between the Servant and God)

What Yasadipura I was trying to do was reconcile previous belief systems with Sharia. In Malay, Indonesian, and Javanese, ""Agama"" is translated as religion.    In Sanskrit, it means tradition or received knowledge conveying **ritual knowledge.**   They are separate from the Vedas. Vedic form of worship requires no shrine or ritual. Agama involves puja (rituals) to idols   Sharia (or ""Agama"" in general), which is just a container to guide one in one's spiritual journey.

The popular Javanese aphorism ""Agomo iku ageman""  captures what Yasadipura was saying.  Literally, the translation is ""religion is clothing.""  However, it's been incorrectly interpreted. Some Javanese wrongly translate this as religion is important because without religion we will be animals.  More orthodox Muslim ethnic groups like the Minang use this to mock the Javanese saying they change religions like others change clothes.

The Javanese are more syncretic than other Muslim-majority ethnic groups for three reasons:

First, Islam spread very gradually on Java, due to Java's large population relative to the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Philippines, and Malaysia). In 1800, Java had over 50% of the region's population.

Secondly, Islam on Java was spread largely by missionaries, not by a ruler converting and everyone else following.

Thirdly, the Javanese attempted to reconcile Islam with their pre-existing beliefs.  While other ethnic groups in Maritime Southeast Asia also did this, the Javanese were more explicit and deliberate. For instance, Malays use the Islamic Calendar, but Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese Muslims also use a Javanese Calendar created by Sultan Agung in 1633, which combines the Hindu Saka Calendar's base year with the Islamic Lunar Calendar. Under the Javanese Calendar, it is the year 1945, like in India.

**ABANGAN VS SANTRI**

Before discussing the religious differences between Javanese and Malays, let's examine how scholars categorize different groups of Javanese. In the mid-19th century, Dutch missionaries who were allowed to preach among the Javanese noticed they were divided into two groups. The first was ""putihan"" (white ones), now referred to as ""Santri,"" a small group of more orthodox Muslims affiliated with the Pesantren (Pondok). ""Santri"" means ""student"" in the Pesantren. [In the 1860s, among a population of 12 million, there were approximately 93,000 students enrolled in Pesantren.](https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/17233)  This group formed the base of NU, currently the largest Muslim organization in Indonesia, which was formed in 1926.

The second group, which made up the majority of Javanese, was ""Abangan"" (red ones). In the 19th century, the typical Abangan were often poorer and more likely to follow folk beliefs than Islam. The Dutch missionaries held a positive view of the Santri, calling them devout and righteous, but characterized the Abangan as poor, spendthrift, superstitious, and prone to drinking and using opium.

While Javanese society has become more ""Islamic"", these divisions still exist.  In Indonesia, many occupations are passed from father to son. Most of the famous Kyai, a Javanese word for the religious teacher, comes from a collection of families. Most of them were born on the North shore of Java and all have Arabic names.  In contrast, Dalang (Javanese puppet masters) and Langgam Singers (Javanese Opera) are almost always abangan, usually born in the interior of Java, and have non-Arabic names (native and Sanskrit).

The conflict between Santri and some segments of the Abangan community reached its climax in the 1965-66 Anti-Communist Purges.  The bulk of the Indonesian Communist Party members was made up of Javanese Abangan and low-caste Balinese Hindus. [There had been tensions in the 1940s during the independence struggle PKI members destroyed mosques because many Santri leaders were landlords affiliated with the Dutch.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1qv3fh.12)   Most of the purges in Indonesia happened on the Northern Coast of East and Central Java and Bali. On Java, backed by the Army, groups of Muslim Youth (Santri) and the Right Wing From Sukarno's Partai Nationalis Indonesia (PNI) went after PKI members.   On Bali, it was Hindu temple watchmen that went after the PKI members.   Roughly 500,000 people died throughout Indonesia.

**MULTI-ETHNIC MALAYS VS MULTI-RELIGIOUS JAVANESE**

Javanese emphasize ethnicity, while the Malays focus on Islam. For example, many of the Malays Sultan have foreign blood (Thai, Arab, British etc), while the Sultan of Yogyakarta, as far as I know is almost 100% Javanese.  The Mataram Sultanate which the Sultanate  Yogyakarta is an offshoot of was insular. Here are the Sultan of Perak and the Sultan of Yogyakarta

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c99hc7m4xoia1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=60f36fee4ba831ccf52a1fa3de5ac8770fd5a367

&#x200B;

[The King of The Netherlands and Sultan of Yogyakarta](https://preview.redd.it/bfehe9v6xoia1.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c2a48a91645e8ceb187d46a0729e942017a515a)

The Sultan of Yogyakarta is the only royal household in Indonesia that is officially recognized by the Republic of Indonesia. The Sultan is the governor of Yogyakarta, and the governorship is hereditary.  Yogyakarta is a special region, along with Aceh and Jakarta.  So the Sultan has **ALOT** more power than a Malaysian Sultan.

Since the Malacca Sultanate, the Malay Peninsula has accepted waves of migration from the rest of the archipelago   The process of assimilation in the ""Malay"" society wasn't automatic. Some groups like the Minang and other non-Malay Sumatrans had an easier time. The Javanese took longer. In Malaysia, [who was considered Malay, varied from state to state. In 1911, the Javanese in Johor were counted separately, by 1952 they were counted as other Malays.](https://kyoto-seas.org/pdf/32/2/320203.pdf)

Unlike Malay society, Javanese society is multi-religious. Muslims make up 95% of the Javanese population, 4% Christian, and 1% Hindu, Buddhist, and Indigenous faiths. In the cities and major towns in Central and East Java, non-Muslims make up anywhere from 10-25% of the population.

Most Javanese non-Muslims ""converted"" after 1965 when the Indonesian government required people to put a religion on their ID card. They had a choice of Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, and  Buddhism. Prior to 1965, the government assumed they were Muslims, but many just followed Kejawen.  [Whole families and villages had to pick a religion, out of fear of being labeled Communist.](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/A_History_of_Christianity_in_Indonesia/cUoGJSs9yOUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=christianity+indonesia&printsec=frontcover)  This would determine the religious life of future generations because Children were given religion classes in their chosen religion. Many people picked Islam because it was the ""dominant"" religion.  In some villages, the villager would collectively decide which religion they should all follow.

Nearly all Javanese Hindus today were or are descendants of Kejawan followers and became Hindu after 1965.  The Indonesian government sent Hindu priests from Bali to instruct them on Hinduism.

The Javanese and Balinese are much more likely to synthesize foreign cultures with the preexisting forms  Here is the Ganjuran Catholic Church built in 1924, located in Central Java.

&#x200B;

**NOTE:** The five ""official"" (now six including Confucianism) religions, are not legally official. The law that introduces them just says that they are the religions followed by most Indonesians.   The reason for this was to streamline religious belief in Indonesia. [From 1930-1960s, there was an explosion of new religions popping up on Java, particularly in West and Central Java.](https://online.ucpress.edu/as/article-abstract/30/2/18/36458/New-Religious-Sects-in-Java?redirectedFrom=fulltext) A lot of them were associated with folk religions.  In 1956, the Religious Affairs Bureau of Yogyakarta counted 56 religious sects on Java outside of Islam and Christianity. By 1959, the Religious Affairs Bureau of East Java counted over 100 sects in East Java alone. While many only had 200-300 members, it was the speed at which they were growing that was of concern to officials.  In Bali in the 1950-60s for example, often each village had its own traditions and rituals.

**MALAY VS JAVANESE RAMAYANA**

The Malay Ramayana or  Hikayat Seri Rama was committed to writing around the 13-15th centuries, even though it was performed longer.  ¬† [The Malay version originated not from the classical Ramayana of Valmiki, but from popular oral versions widely spread over southern India](https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2014/05/the-ramayana-in-southeast-asia-4-indonesia-and-malaysia.html).  However, it still follows the plot of Valmiki's version with changes like replacing Hindu Gods with Allah in some instances.

The Javanese Ramayana or Kakawin Ramayana was most likely written in 856-930 during the Mataram Kingdom using Old Javanese. [The Javanese Ramayana differs from most versions of the Ramayana, because it doesn't use the popular Valmiki version, but the first half is taken from  Bha·π≠·π≠ikƒÅvya, a 6-7th century poem about the adventures of Rama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bha%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADik%C4%81vya) In the latter half. the all-powerful Javanese indigenous Guardian God of Java Semar emerges with his misshapen sons, *Gareng*, *Petruk*, and *Bagong* who make up the four [Punokawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punokawan) or ""clown servants"".

# STABILITY VS REVOLUTION

For Malays, the Malacca Sultanate is the golden age. In contrast, for the Javanese, the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit is their historical highpoint, because it became the dominant power in Maritime Southeast Asia after the Sriwijaya was defeated by the Majapahit's predecessor kingdom, the Singasari.

**JOHOR SULTANATE VS MATARAM SULTANATE**

However, more important, are the prominent kingdoms that followed the Malacca Sultanate and Majapahit, the Johor Sultanate, and the Mataram Sultanate.

The Johor Sultanate's political structure was like other Southeast Asia states before it.  It was a decentralized system, made up of Sultan's territory, and four main fiefs.   The fiefs were Muar and its territories under the Raja Temenggong of Muar; Pahang under the stewardship of the Bendehara; Riau under the control of YAM Tuan Muda and mainland Johor and Singapore under the Temenggong.  Secondly, Johor, like the Maritime Southeast Asian kingdoms before it, focused on trade and controlling trade routes.  In terms of control and influence, at its peak, the Johor Sultanate surpassed Malacca.

In contrast, the Mataram Sultanate under Sultan Agung focused on conquering the whole island of Java. Furthermore, he established a centralized system, where he would appoint an official from the capital, the adipati, to rule the conquered territory, [The conquered ruler and much of his family would be moved to the capital often as ""hostages"" as well as bringing captive laborers and craftsmen to build the Mataram capital](https://beritagar.id/artikel/telatah/mataram-dan-kolonialisme-internal-jawa).

Unfortunately,  this centralized structure antagonized local elites and resulted in numerous rebellions and wars, The expensive military campaigns caused the Mataram Sultanate to borrow money from the VOC (Dutch East Indies Company). [When it couldn't pay the debt, it conceded land to the VOC. However, eventually, the VOC itself went bankrupt in 1799.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company)  In the 19th century, the Dutch government had taken over from the VOC, and spread this centralized system to the rest of Indonesia. The Republic of Indonesia inherited this system from the Dutch.  Indonesia only moved away from this centralized system beginning in 2003.

The biggest problem the Javanese Sultanates, including the Mataram Sultanate, had was trying to convince their subjects they were the successor to the Majapahit, while only having dubious lineage to the Majapahit. The chaos and wars of this period, are most likely the reason why Javanese parents don't name their kids after rulers of the Mataram Sultanate, the way they do with Majapahit rulers.

It's not just the Javanese that had chaotic and tumultuous rule under the Muslim Sultanates, after the fall of Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms.  The Sundanese were never completely ruled by a Muslim Sultanate of their own after the Hindu-Buddhist Kingdom of Sunda fell in 1579. Some parts were ruled by the Banten Sultanate, and some by Mataram Sultanate.

# PROGRESS, PROPHECY, AND ROMANTICISM

Malays view time as linear, meaning people progress. However,  what you define as progress is subjective. PAS has its own definition of ""progress"". Moreover, when one says a person is conservative in the literal sense it means the person isn't willing to change.  A Javanese woman in her 70s who doesn't wear the hijab, because she never wore one, isn't being progressive, but conservative or traditional.

In contrast, Javanese society's first instinct, when faced with a serious crisis, is to circle back to the past. One sees this during the late-Majapahit period when the Javanese begin to abandon Hindu Buddhism and begin to worship their Austronesian gods. One sees it again after the Java War in 1825-30.

**PROPHECIES**

Since the fall of the Majapahit in the early 1500s, the Javanese have written semi-fictitious histories of the Majapahit, some negative, others positive.  Historians use these accounts when more credible sources don't exist. However, many of these texts are really an indirect commentary on the political and social conditions at the time and often prophesize future events.  The most famous is the prophecy of Jayabaya, written in the 1700s, which foreshadowed, [the Dutch colonization and the Japanese invasion](https://www.kompas.com/skola/read/2020/04/16/170000469/sambutan-rakyat-indonesia-terhadap-jepang?page=all#:~:text=Bunyi%20ramalan%20Jayabaya%20tentang%20Jepang,sesudah%20itu%20Jawa%20akan%20merdeka.%22)

>Pulau Jawa kelak akan diperintah bangsa kulit putih (Belanda), kemudian dari arah utara akan datang bangsa Katai, kulit kuning bermata sipit. Pemerintahan dari bangsa kulit kuning tidak lama, hanya seumur jagung. Dan sesudah itu Jawa akan merdeka

According to the website of Indonesia's Ministry of Education and Culture, the Indonesians who believed in the prophecy (Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese) welcomed the Japanese, because it meant the prophecy was true.  The prophecy also says it will usher in a new golden age (Zaman Mas)  similar to the Majapahit.

Tied to the golden age, is the main character, Satrio Piningit (the Hidden Knight) who will rise from nowhere to become Ratu Adil (Just King). Satrio Pinigit comes up repeatedly in Javanese/Indonesian history. [According to Peter Carey, a historian, who wrote a history of the leader of the Java War 1825-30, Diponogoro, some Javanese believed Diponogoro was the Satrio Pinigit.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26527700) Sukarno, Suharto to Jokowi were prophesied as the Satrio Pinigit.

While people might dismiss this as superstition, talking about this prophecy and others is still very popular among Indonesians. There are newspaper and magazine articles, [youtube videos with hundreds of thousands if not millions of views.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bar6ucZ2dIA)

**INFLUENCE OF EUROPEAN ROMANTICISM**

Both Indonesian and Malay nationalism was influenced by [European Romanticism 1780-1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism).

In Malaysia, early Malay nationalism has its basis in romantic nationalism.  Malay nationalism is ethnic-based nationalism, similar to ethnic German nationalism.   Both transitioned from popular movements to elite-dominated ones.  In the case of the Malays, the Malay Sultanates, for  Germany, the Prussian state.

In Indonesia, the influence of European romanticism starts in the 1830s, after the Java War of 1825-30. The Java War was a rebellion started by Diponogoro, the first son of the Sultan of Yogyakarta, who was passed over for his younger half-brother. Eventually, Diponogoro was captured in 1830. The War cost 200,000 lives  (3-4% of the Javanese population).

&#x200B;

[Raden Salah's Painting \\""Arrest of Diponogoro's\\"" painted in 1857](https://preview.redd.it/mgzl1smrwoia1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5827cdf715607bb5a885f209db0b1e6215026a3d)

The Diponogoro's defeat leads to a crisis in Javanese society. Shortly after, the Dutch introduced the Cultivation System which forced farmers on Java to grow cash crops.  Also, the more orthodox version of Islam starts to arrive from the Middle East.  In the midst of these events, three anti-Islamic works appeared.  [The three works are Babad Kedhiri (1873), Suluk Gatholoco (1872 latest) and Serat Dermagandhul (1873)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=_HYiqv333C8C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=Babad+Kedhiri&source=bl&ots=SOoNsfsiN1&sig=ACfU3U1_esZD1dATiuHltFxmPcSHx_JwPA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic8sGA6cvjAhUBFnwKHUgoDf0Q6AEwB3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Babad%20Kedhiri&f=false). A common theme is they view Islam as a civilizational disaster and call for a return to Hindu Buddhism.  The works bash Arabs and the Chinese. [Gatholoco and Demagandhul are absurdist works because the characters are an ambulatory penis (Gatholoco) with a hanging ballsack (Demagandhul)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3350926)[.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3350926) The dates shown are the published dates or were first noticed by Dutch missionaries. [Scholars suspect these three texts were written sometime after Java War, 1830 to 1860s](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/53727/INDO_32_0_1107016107_109_150.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).  The authorship of the works is unknown, for example, some have attributed Darmagandhul to Ronggawarsita or to [Tunggul Wulung](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai_Ibrahim_Tunggul_Wulung).

**NOTE:**   Under Suharto, these three works were banned, because of their bawdy nature and anti-Islamic content.  Gatholoco is a journey of a walking and talking penis who has debates with the ulema, in between visiting opium dens and having sex.    Conservative Muslims hate these three works, going as far as to say they were fabricated by the Dutch to smear the Ulema and Santri.    All of them have been translated into Indonesian, and the last two have been translated into English by Benedict Anderson. This might sound absurd if you didn't know that in 1814, the Sultanate of Yogyakarta commissioned one of the greatest works in Javanese literature, Serat Centhini, which many Javanese consider the Kamasutra of Java with depictions of graphic sex including homosexuality.

# MALAY VS INDONESIAN NATIONALISM

What I am going to do here is examine nationalism from the basis of time and change, does nationalism look at the past,  present or future?  Does it seek to maintain or change the political structure?

Malay nationalism is conservative and is focused on maintaining the authority of the Malay Sultanates.  For example, the stripes on the Malaysian flag represent the 14 states, the Cresent represents Islam, and yellow is the color of the Malay Sultans.   Indonesian nationalism is romantic and revolutionary. It uses the past as inspiration. Indonesia's national symbols and motto are taken from the Majapahit. It's similar to Indian nationalism. The symbol on the Indian Flag is taken from  *Ashoka* Chakra, the symbol of the [Mauryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauryan) Empire of 300BC. Both Indian and Indonesian romantic nationalism is rooted in part in the rediscovery of the past. Ashoka's Chakra was discovered in 1905. Borobodur was discovered in 1815.

# CONCLUSION

A lot of what I covered here won't be familiar to even people of Javanese descent in Malaysia. The Javanese culture you have in Malaysia is the more orthodox Muslim peasant culture of the North coast of Java. Furthermore, a lot of the unIslamic aspects of Javanese culture have been abandoned over time in Malaysia.

This post is just an introduction to some of the more important differences between the two groups.  There are many other areas like differences in archaeology, art, music, popular culture, relations with other ethnic groups, and politics These influence both countries domestically and internationally.",2023-02-17 14:11:59

comment,,23,j8wqpby,,1676644423.0,"To all my Malaysian friends, you might find it surprising that there are entire *villages* scattered around in Central and East Java where the majority religion is not Islam, yet the residents of the village are still ethnically Javanese.

That's simply not true. Increasing minimum wage will definitely increase inflation. Because people will have more money but supply remains same. That's literally definition of inflation. Increasing EPF, people will still have same amount of money, any hike in price comes from business and competition and spending power usually will flatten the curve. Meanwhile, reduces old age poverty.

You cant expect the new administration to just throw everything in the bin. There are some long term projects and policies. Just stopping them mid way will just create problems. As some policies are linked to each other. There are also policies already planned to be introduced this year by past administration. So whatever we see done this year is just what previous administration planned. 

The 1st year should be used to come up with the groundwork for the new administration. Which is what im seeing anwar doing. Meeting people here there. Streghtening ties with east malaysia and royalty, meet other country leaders and so on. 

Thats why for me all this 100 days as PM is just a political gimmick.",2023-02-02 15:21:08

Declaration should include 3years before going into office and continue 3 years after leaving office. And wrongful declaration should be made a crime, as well as using family members and friends to hide ill gotten gains should be a crime. Make this into law and i will be happier than just cutting MP salary which is just a populist move. Just cutting salary without any reforms will actually incentivize MPs into taking bribes.

The same politics of a race protected by law, states using fear of the federal government to shield themselves from criticism of state failings, poor education policy for the poor resulting in a body politic that will rail at federal for something their local champion is in control of. 

People who control states like the Carolinas, Texas, Mississippi, etc , that are very resource based, or agricultural, have a benefit in keeping their people stupid much in the same vain a poor African resource rich nation does. What's under the ground, or a geographical characteristic is more valuable than the people atop it. Simultaneously, some other states that are often more directly responsible for the wealth, have been developing human capital and greater economic growth is dependent on the development of that particular resource. So liberalism thrives in some states while feudalism is being artificially sustained in others. One is directly threatened and to survive goes on the offensive and suddenly political discourse more often than not, turns into a cultural battlefield.

That being said, it is ""normal"" to find wrongdoings like tender in government procurement.

comment,,38,ixpcbdo,,1669356658.0,"There are several reasons why Indonesians like Anwar

* For secular reformers, Anwar presents a modernizing figure.  His close association with Habibie helps.
* For Reform Muslims, he is someone who is both a nationalist, a political reformer, and a devout Muslim. Mainstream Indonesian nationalism isn't friendly to ""orthodox"" Muslims, because they are seen as being against the Pancasila State and want to impose Sharia on Indonesia.
* Indonesian presidents are Javanese or part Javanese, and often aren't seen as Islamic enough by many non-Javanese.  For many non-Javanese, it's really difficult to understand how the Javanese operate. How they think about politics is heavily influenced by the Ramayana and Mahabharata.  Jokowi and Suharto, being Central Javanese, are the worst in this regard.
* Many young Indonesians see most of Indonesia's Javanese Presidents as too old-fashioned and traditional. Despite what many Malaysians think, Jokowi isn't popular among Indonesian Muslim youth (less than 40%), but very popular among the elderly (70% or above for people over 70).  When a Singaporean reporter asked Jokowi who was his favorite superhero.  [He said Krishna, the avatar of Indra.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6_J5pgL-VE)

For the Indonesian state, Malaysia under various UMNO governments has often been a pain.  Giving refuge to Abu Bakar Bashir in the 1980-90s is a good example. In a more recent incident, was Najib trying to draw an example from what happened with Ahok of what the Malaysian Chinese shouldn't do.  Ahok was a political ally of Jokowi. How do you think Jokowi felt about that.",2022-11-25 14:10:58

Third, with Him as the Prime Minister, Indonesian has easier time to convince Malaysian to unite.

comment,,23,ixpgmfi,,1669359913.0,"During Ahok case, Jokowi was bombarded with questions whether or not he will intervene. Ahok was very competent leader and no nonsense personality. If someone work bad, he will fire them without a second thought. For easier comparison, imagine if Gordon Ramsey expert at governing instead of cooking, that's Ahok. Back to the point, if Ahok got jailed, that mean Indonesia would lose it's second most competent leader. So that's why journalist asked whether or not Jokowi would risked indonesia bright future by letting Ahok case free from intervention *(People were speculating Ahok will become his Vice President during Jokowi 2nd term)*.

Jokowi took a safer route, he did not intervene and Ahok got jailed for 2 years *(the minimum jail sentence for blasphemy*). During Ahok in prison, Jakarta lead by incompetent leader (just what most people expected after losing Ahok). But Ahok in jail does not mean Jokowi did not care about him.

Once Ahok got released, Jokowi use Ahok as an ""eagle eye"" to watch Pertamina *(Oil Company, similar like Petronas)* from oil mafia and corruption. So far, Pertamina has been doing well ever since Ahok become the comissioner of Pertamina.",2022-11-25 15:05:13

Plus, even if BN and he win, Rafizi did point out that he would likely be sidelined by Zahid, which based on Zahid‚Äôs track record, seems plausible. Even if he doesn‚Äôt get sidelined, we already know he‚Äôd never be willing to oppose Zahid and his cronies.

If he wins though, it would send a strong message that KJ is charismatic enough to win even a danger seat, which would increase his power in UMNO, become a bigger threat to Zahid, making Zahid look even worst with so many court cases on him.

I personally believed that they are trying to safeguard this already, by telling the public that Sungai Buloh is a safe seat when they can't even fool blind person that it is not. In case he wins it, they would downplay his achievements  in hope of him not getting much power.",2022-11-04 18:23:28

This will also take up more time if SE were to be done together since the times it takes to count the vote double.

Other than that,they probably want better representation from the community. If there were a floods happening during the voting day (or couple of days before that), there will be people who are unable to go to the voting centre, most probably floods victims and volunteers. Thus, this portion of voter will not be represented during this election if there were to happen.

Why?

* China has capital control risk.
* selling yuan holdings requires a separate agreement during time of crisis which builds even more distrust.

I forgot what response was it towards but London is the world financial centre i can imagine decisions over there can have some weight over geopolitics.

The americans weaponising USD is a known fact. When Iraq wanted the americans to shut down their bases in Iraq and leave after they drone strike Suleimani without the iraqi's permission, the Iraqi's were told , subtly and very quietly, that they will lose access to US dollar if they do that, Iraq very quickly reversed that decision.

As of pegging local currency to USD, thats a non story , or a strawman. NO one is saying you need permission from the US to peg your currency to USD , you just need the permission from your foreign reserves...

You are right in a sense ,  the US does not go around attack every country that dont trade in USD , (or sell oil in USD), it depends on US foreign policy needs at that time and the country's ranking in global standing order, and the practicality of that . Of course they not going to attack Malaysia, they need to find a convenient reason to smear whoever they attack first. Watch out for things like ""Malaysia has weapons of mass destruction"" or ""Malaysia committing genocide.."" kind of news on CNN...

And for the last one (BN/UMNO) it can be heavily seen from places like after Johor elections that the current face/leader of the coalition (Sabri) has his hands very much tied by the influence of the court cluster.

If I invest into your company by getting 10% of the stock for 10k, and your company goes bankrupt, I could potentially end up with no money cause I'd be last in priority to receive the money from the sale of assets.

If instead your company grows to 10 billion, I now own 10% off the value of the company ( slightly simplified)

With a loan, I loan you 10k, and expect you to pay 6% interest every year for 5 years.

If your company goes bankrupt, I'm higher on the priority list to get my loans paid back that the investors.

If your Company then grows to 10 billion in those 5 years, Im not suddenly able to charge you extra money. I still get 10k + 6% interest for the 5 years. 

In this case, if China gives us loans, we still have to pay those loans if the machinery/research/infrastructure we buy with those loans don't pay off for us.

post,Short Analysis of PKR's Asset Declaration,64,yrzezo,27,1668135480.0,"So let me preface this by saying that most of what I'm saying is kind of speculation. Some of these asset declarations have not enough information to know for certain. Just listing down things I thought were interesting. I will only be going through the ""famous"" people under PKR.

Source: [https://calonkeadilan.org/](https://calonkeadilan.org/)

**Phrabakaran - Batu**

* His asset declaration is far from complete. Where is your income la dei? No expenses also. Did you not understand the task that was asked of you?
* He has a remaining RM 117K on his personal loan. WTF.

**Fahmi Fadzil - Lembah Pantai**

* Savings are really low for someone who is 41 years old. How the hell does he have only RM20K in his EPF?
* I don't think his Toyota Veilfire 2015 has an asset value of RM225K still. Probably closer to RM180K
* He must like art seeing he has spent RM16K on it. Tough arguably RM16K is not a lot.

**Mazlee Malik - Simpang Reggam**

* No money in his bank accounts (supposedly).
* EPF also very low at RM20K.
* He seems incredibly over leveraged. Most if not all assets he has are on the back of liabilities (i.e. loans). Cannot imagine how he would pay for all of this if he lost his MP position.

**Adam Adli - Hang Tuah Jaya**

* Nothing to say but he is in poverty tier. Based on his income alone he is B40. Dude needs this MP job.

**Nurul Izzah - Permatang Pauh**

* Quite decent savings
* Her expenses are really high. As if she takes on the expenses for the entire household. Once you consider tax she is close to zero savings per month
* Interestingly she contributes/donates RM3K to the PKR every month

**Anwar Ibrahim - Tambun**

* Spoiler alert >!he is rich!<
* Most of his wealth comes from property and specifically one property valued at RM9mil in Segambut. Though I am certain he is worth more than RM11mil in total.
* He doesn't have a car. Not sure if PKR provides a car for him. Not going to analyze Wan Azizah, but she has 4 vehicles under her name.
* Zero debt

**Amiruddin Shahri - Gombak**

* Nothing to notable to speak of in terms of assets and liabilities
* His income on the other hand. Monthly income is RM 179K
* Was he sick or something recently? He gets this RM 310K per year for ""Leave Passage"" from who knows where. Maybe from Selangor state. And he is claiming RM 189K from his medical insurance.
* Why would you get leave passage and still draw a salary? Sus.

**Rafizi Ramli - Pandan**

* Probably the most complete and transparent declaration there is.
* As mentioned by him in the press, the majority of his ""wealth"" comes from his shareholdings of Invoke. Those valuation numbers are subjective.

I assume some of them have low EPF (or no EPF) because once you are an MP you contribute to KWAP. But I mean some of them like Fahmi Fadzil must have had non-public office jobs before.",2022-11-11 10:58:00

Revenue, not income. That's not a lot tbh. Imagine 10 staff at 4k, that's already 500k py gone on salary alone. I don't think Invoke runs with only 10 staff, probably closer to 20 (you need data analyst, callers/ground support, survey coordinators etc). 

Think they also do a lot more than just political analysis services. They're an intelligence gathering and analysis service, as with lots of other classic names you see in polling/surveys like yougov, Emerson, Rasmussen etc. Political polling is the biggest barometer of this sector's accuracy, because there is a direct result that you can compare it to (if you can accurately survey how people are going to vote, you can probably accurately survey how people feel about Brand A for example).",2022-11-11 13:11:22

comment,,33,iykng8d,,1669948060.0,"Question:  What will be the future outcomes for Malaysia if the current PAS President, Hadi Awang becomes the Prime Minister of Malaysia?  

&#x200B;

ChatGPT:  If Hadi Awang were to become the Prime Minister of Malaysia, it is likely that he would implement policies that reflect his conservative and religious views. This could include the implementation of Islamic law in Malaysia, as well as the restriction of certain rights and freedoms, such as the rights of LGBTQ individuals. This could also lead to increased tension and conflict within the country, as not all Malaysians share Hadi Awang's views and beliefs. Additionally, Hadi Awang's leadership could potentially harm Malaysia's relationships with other countries and damage the country's economy.",2022-12-02 10:27:40

He has been the party's president since 2002, and has been a member of the Malaysian Parliament since 2004. Hadi Awang is known for his conservative and religious views, and has been a vocal advocate for the implementation of Islamic law in Malaysia. He has also been involved in several controversies, including his support for the discrimination of LGBTQ individuals in Malaysia. ""

post,PM: Empty talk not my style,48,ydmp4k,38,1666751600.0,"
KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said empty talk and making false promises by using debate as held by Pakatan Harapan in the 14th General Election is not his way.

It would be better for him to focus on serving the people and devoting more attention to the preparations ahead of GE15 in terms of people‚Äôs safety rather than engaging in debates, he said.

‚ÄúIt is better for me to personally meet people from various races, as well as the social strata as a family,‚Äù said the Prime Minister in a Facebook post yesterday.

Earlier yesterday at a function, reporters asked him about Pakatan chairman Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim‚Äôs proposal to hold a debate among prime minister candidates.

‚ÄúIs it enough to gain popularity by making sweet promises in debates? He (Anwar) needs to have compassion for fishermen, farmers and even young people who have been deceived by the various rhetoric of debates done before.

‚ÄúI suggest that he debate when the parliamentary session is held after the new government has been elected by the people. Or maybe on the stage of their respective parties, and there, no one will stand in the way because this country practises a democratic system,‚Äù he said.

He also pointed out that debates were also not part of Malaysia‚Äôs political culture.

On another matter, Ismail Sabri said Umno was considering stricter vetting on possible candidates for the elections.

‚ÄúThe respective state liaison committees have presented their list of candidates for the first round of discussion. We are looking to conduct stricter vetting of candidates, including checking with various departments including the police and Insolvency Department.

‚ÄúWe might even check with religious authorities to determine if the proposed candidates have any other offences,‚Äù he said.

Ismail Sabri was asked if the list of candidates for Umno had been discussed among the party‚Äôs top five leaders.",2022-10-26 10:33:20

In the age when misinformation is at the all time high, it is a necessity for the rakyat to fully understand polices constructed by the leaders. Debates will solve this issue. And to judge the quality of said policies, it must be scrutinized and debated.

Right now what we have is just politicians posting their stuff on socmed platforms; communicating back and forth with other politicians. This is not a proper way.

For Beijing, the oil and gas and fisheries are secondary concerns, they're nice to have but maybe even nicer if others have it given the costs and benefits involved. The primary concern is about positioning itself to preempt moves by the US and its allies in a region close to Chinese shores. On the public face of it, they keep up the image by voicing objections and have their ships harass ours and others, but what good are territorial claims if you don't in fact effectively enforce it? That tells us that the whole nine dashed lines serves as having a foot at the door when the need arises.

Some Singaporeans were wary about Mahathir‚Äôs return to power when PH won in 2018. In the end, their worries were proven right - Tun M cancelled the HSR, parked ships off Tuas. To a degree, older folks are also wary about Anwar due to his actions in his UMNO phase.

post,"2 DPMs in Anwar‚Äôs 25-member Cabinet, says source",32,z8ks7e,46,1669792800.0,"There will be two deputy prime ministers in Anwar Ibrahim‚Äôs Cabinet, which will comprise 25 members, says a source in the know.

The source said the deputy prime ministers will come from Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) and Barisan Nasional, specifically Umno.

PKR, Umno, DAP and GPS are likely to be given the most ministerial posts. Warisan, Amanah and Upko are also slated to be included in the Pakatan Harapan chairman‚Äôs Cabinet.

The source also said Anwar is expected to unveil his Cabinet tomorrow.

Anwar, the Tambun MP, was sworn in as the 10th prime minister last Thursday.

Previously, Umno deputy president Mohamad Hasan, also known as Tok Mat, was said to be the frontrunner for one of the two deputy prime minister‚Äôs posts.

There were also rumours that Warisan president Shafie Apdal was set to be named as the second deputy prime minister.

Anwar has been urged not to include BN chairman Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and other MPs with ongoing court cases, including DAP chairman Lim Guan Eng and Muda president Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, in his Cabinet.

However, yesterday, former PKR vice-president Tian Chua said Zahid could play a key role in stabilising Anwar‚Äôs government, having already been instrumental in getting BN to jointly form the unity government.",2022-11-30 15:20:00

post,What is the possibility that Zahid Hamidi intentionally kill BN internally?,30,yjxu4f,53,1667371566.0,"With the latest BN PRU-15 candidates announcement yesterday, it seems that Zahid Hamidi has made a major mistake by dropping out many ""winnable and local-favourite"" candidates who are more aligned with Ismail Sabri or pro-Muafakat Nasional coalition, in favour of new faces or candidates that are more ""Zahid friendly"" but not so popular within the local voters. The move was seen as illogical by many as it may cost a huge turnover and blow to the party.

The question is, what is the possibility he intentionally kill his party in favour of Anwar Ibrahim and PH to win this election, in return for Anwar's protection against him? As we all know there is a ""secret talk"" between him and Anwar last year, exposed by Annuar Musa, indicating that there is a possibility for them to work together.

In 2018 the vote share between PH, BN and PAS were 50%, 33% and 16% respectively. Basically a 50-50 share if BN and PAS cooperated. 

With this sharply marginal divide, a slight push would allow PH to win Perak with a bit of a breathing space. Regardless of what we think of Anwar i personally think he has some pull over marginal voters and fence sitters. 

However, it does seem like a gamble given how the dynamics has change. Two things come to mind is the dynamics of voting pattern and the Undi18 effect. 

Since Faizal Azumu, the Tambun incumbent, is from Bersatu, the vote percentage for PH in 2018 might not be the same. Faizal wouldve lost in 2018 had PAS and BN cooperated. As for the Undi18 impact, they are kind of a wild card and if the Johor state election is any tell, atleast 40% might go to BN. And don't forget the younger ones may not know who Anwar is, so Anwar might not able to gain those edge.

comment,,19,iz8mwtc,,1670397921.0,"*For the benefit of those running into paywall*

Anwar Ibrahim‚Äôs arrival as Malaysia‚Äôs prime minister caps one of the world‚Äôs most extraordinary political journeys. It also brings a crucial chance for the south-east Asian country to heal social and political divisions while recovering its credibility on the world stage.

Anwar, 75, was widely seen as a future leader as long ago as 1997 when, as deputy prime minister, he helped steer Malaysia through the Asian financial crisis. But after he was sacked in 1998 by his mentor-turned-nemesis Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar was jailed on trumped-up charges of sodomy and corruption. After that conviction was overturned in 2004 and Anwar returned as an opposition leader, his political ambitions were truncated by a second sentence for sodomy in 2015. He then ran, from prison, in the 2018 election, rejoining Mahathir in a victorious new coalition. A royal pardon allowed him to resume political life.

Such vicissitudes speak to Anwar‚Äôs capacity for political survival. But they do not lessen the huge task he faces after a divisive election that returned Malaysia‚Äôs first hung parliament.

One of Anwar‚Äôs biggest assignments is to restore Malaysia‚Äôs reputation following a long-running corruption scandal that led to the sentencing this year of former prime minister Najib Razak to 12 years in prison. Najib was found guilty in 2020 of breach of trust, abuse of power and money laundering related to 1MDB, a state fund. A US attorney-general once described the embezzlement of billions of dollars from 1MDB as ‚Äúkleptocracy at its worst‚Äù.

Anwar, who has also taken on the job of finance minister, has rightly pledged to fight corruption. He has, meanwhile, shown solidarity with many Malaysians struggling with rising living costs by saying he will take no salary. His promise to reinvigorate growth and tackle inflation has helped boost local market sentiment.

Yet Anwar‚Äôs most delicate balancing act is set to be political. His coalition, Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), won the most seats but fell short of a majority. That has led to an uneasy power-sharing arrangement, with a portion of his cabinet composed of members of opposition parties, including the former governing Barisan Nasional.

The BN‚Äôs worst ever performance in the latest election, in part because of the 1MDB scandal, was an emphatic rejection by voters of a coalition that had dominated Malaysia‚Äôs politics since independence in 1957. Anwar‚Äôs naming of the BN leader Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who faces graft charges, as a deputy prime minister will not go down well with his voters.

Striking a balance in representation for Malaysia‚Äôs indigenous Malay majority and its ethnic Chinese and ethnic Indian minorities will also be crucial. Anwar, a Malay Muslim, is well aware that one of the reasons for the collapse of a previous governing coalition led by his party was losing the confidence of the Malays.

Should Anwar be seen to fail, Malaysia could find itself at the mercy of unsettling political trends. The opposition Perikatan Nasional is dominated by an Islamist party that enjoyed explosive success in the latest election. Malay voters seemed undeterred by the party‚Äôs enforcement of conservative laws in the states it controls. If reform stalls and sleaze persists, it stands a good chance of winning power at the next election.

In foreign policy, the new prime minister will again require balancing skills. Anwar should try to recalibrate the tilt towards China that characterised Najib‚Äôs leadership and foster stronger US and European ties. He could find an example in neighbouring Singapore, south-east Asia‚Äôs expert at balancing rival interests.",2022-12-07 15:25:21

post,"'Sidelined' by Anwar-led govt, MCA and MIC invited to join PN",13,11wedij,19,1679305985.0,"A Bersatu leader today said MCA and MIC are welcome to join Perikatan Nasional and suggested that the two parties abandon their BN coalition and the unity government.

According to S Subramaniam (above), who is Bersatu associate wing information chief, both MCA and MIC had allegedly been sidelined by the Anwar Ibrahim-led unity government.

They are also not being appreciated by BN chairperson Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, he said.

Subramaniam told Malaysiakini that this could be seen from the cabinet line-up, where none of their leaders was on the list.


""This clearly shows the parties are no longer being appreciated by Zahid.

""So, I am asking MCA and MIC to rethink their position in BN, and they are welcomed to join PN,"" he said.

When Anwar formed his cabinet after being sworn in as Malaysia's 10th prime minister in November last year, no MCA or MIC leaders were on his list of ministers.


Prior to this, both parties had been uneasy towards Zahid's plan to form a unity government with Pakatan Harapan.

MCA only won two parliamentary seats in the last general election, namely Ayer Hitam (Wee Ka Siong) and Tanjung Piai (Wee Jeck Seng). Ka Siong is the MCA president while Jeck Seng is a member of the party's central leadership committee.

MIC only won one parliamentary seat in the election through its deputy president M Saravanan (Tapah).

Besides MCA and MIC, two other BN component parties are Umno and PBRS.

Umno was given six ministerial and five deputy minister posts under the current unity government, while PBRS received one deputy minister post.

MCA president SA Vigneswaran had previously said MIC would not demand any seat in the cabinet, in respect of BN's position against having Anwar and DAP in the government.

However, the former Dewan Negara president added that the party was willing to accept if Anwar offers them a position in the government.

May become irrelevant

Meanwhile, Subramaniam said MCA and MIC may become irrelevant and ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù from politics altogether if they continue to stick with BN in the upcoming state elections.

""From what I was informed, both parties were not even invited to discuss seat allocation for the state elections.

""Most probably they would get maybe one seat in each state, or maybe none at all.

""This is because of vindictive politics practiced by certain Umno leaders against the two parties,"" he said.

Previously, MCA and MIC leaders had a disagreement with certain Umno leaders when the Malay-based party wanted to topple Muhyiddin Yassin as a prime minister.

The two parties did not support Umno supreme council's decision then to withdraw their support to Muhyiddin.
