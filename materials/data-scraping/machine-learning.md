# Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to train models that can automatically extract data from web pages, a process commonly known as web scraping or web crawling. By using ML algorithms, models can learn to recognize patterns in the HTML or CSS code of web pages and extract the relevant data without the need for human intervention.

There are several ML techniques that can be used for web scraping, including:

1. **Supervised learning**: This involves training a model using labeled data, where the model learns to recognize patterns in the HTML or CSS code of web pages based on the labels provided. For example, a model could be trained to recognize the title of a news article based on its HTML tags.

2. **Unsupervised learning**: This involves training a model without labeled data, where the model learns to recognize patterns in the HTML or CSS code of web pages based on similarities in the data. For example, a model could be trained to group similar products on an e-commerce website based on their HTML attributes.

3. **Deep learning**: This involves training a neural network model that can learn to recognize patterns in the HTML or CSS code of web pages by analyzing multiple layers of data. For example, a deep learning model could be trained to extract product information from e-commerce websites by analyzing the text, images, and other multimedia content on the page.

Machine learning techniques can be particularly useful for web scraping tasks that require a high degree of accuracy or precision, such as extracting financial data or medical records. However, it's important to note that ML models require a significant amount of training data and can be computationally expensive to train, so they may not be suitable for all web scraping tasks. Additionally, web scraping can raise ethical and legal concerns, so it's important to ensure that any data collected is used in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
