<h1 align=center>Customer Analysis System with CRUD Operations üîç</h1>
<p align='justify'> Data science studies how to extract knowledge and insights from data using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems. Data science can be used to create customer analysis systems capable of collecting, storing, analyzing, and visualizing customer data. Customer analysis is the process of gathering, analysing, and interpreting data about customers in order to gain insights into their behaviour and preferences. This data can then be used to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. The system in this assignment is built using MongoDB, MySQL, and PHP. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that can store and query large amounts of unstructured data. MySQL is a relational database designed for storing and querying structured data. PHP is a scripting language that can be used to create web applications on the server. There are several steps to develop the customer analysis system which are designing the system, setting up the development environment, implementing CRUD operations with MongoDB and MySQL, writing PHP scripts to preprocess and analyze the data, and creating a web interface.</p>

## Summary
The Customer Analysis system has effectively collected and stored diverse customer data and performed CRUD operations, data preprocessing, and analysis using MongoDB, MySQL, and PHP. The web interface supports seamless integration and data visualization.

## Key Findings:

- Based on our records, the average age of our customers is 48.96 years old. It is worth noting that most of our customers gender is female. Additionally, a significant portion of our customer works as artists. Lastly, the mean annual income for our customers is 110731.82.
