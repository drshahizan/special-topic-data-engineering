## Data Engineering
`Data Engineer` refers to a person who is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the infrastructure that supports the storage, processing, and analysis of large volumes of data. To ensure that data is gathered, saved, and made accessible for use by data scientists and other stakeholders, data engineers employ a variety of technologies, including databases, data pipelines, and data warehouses. Data engineers are professionals in the design and implementation of data systems.

- What do they do?
  -  collecting, managing, and converting raw data into information that can be interpreted by data scientists and business analysts. Data accessibility is their ultimate goal, which is to enable organizations to utilize data for performance evaluation and optimization.



`Data Engineering` is a field that includes the process, tools, and techniques used to design, develop and maintain the systems and infrastructure that support the data needs of an organization. In order to make sure that data is available and accessible for analysis and decision-making, data engineering makes use of a variety of technologies, including databases, data pipelines, and data warehouses.

## Data Science
`Data Science` is an interdisciplinary field that includes the use of statistical and computational methods, machine learning, and other ways to extract knowledge and insight from data. Data science includes a range of activities, including data collection, cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization, which aims to find trends, forecast the future, and guide decision-making.

`Data Scientist` is a person who uses their skills and expertise in data science to solve complex problems by analyzing and interpreting large, complex datasets. Data scientists typically have a strong background in statistics, mathematics, and programming, and are able to develop and apply machine learning algorithms and other techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data.

## Data Scientist vs Data Engineer
`Data Scientist` and `Data Engineer` are two distinct roles in the field of data science. While there are some overlaps in their skill sets, their responsibilities and focuses are different.

A `Data Scientist` is responsible for using statistical and computational methods to extract insights from data. They work with large and complex datasets, apply machine learning algorithms, and build predictive models to solve business problems. They need to have a strong background in statistics, programming, and machine learning.

On the other hand, a `Data Engineer` is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure that allows Data Scientists to work with data. They are responsible for data collection, storage, processing, and management. They design and implement data pipelines, develop and maintain databases, and ensure data quality and integrity. They need to have strong programming skills and expertise in big data technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases.

In summary, a `Data Scientist` is focused on extracting insights from data, while a `Data Engineer` is focused on building and maintaining the infrastructure that allows data analysis to take place. While there is some overlap in their skill sets, the two roles require different expertise and responsibilities.

## Relationship Data Engineer & Data Scientist
Data engineers and data scientists have a collaborative relationship that is critical to the success of data-driven projects.

Data engineers provide the necessary infrastructure for data storage, data retrieval, and data processing. They work on designing and building data pipelines that transform and move data from various sources into data warehouses, data lakes, or other data storage systems. Data engineers also ensure data quality, data security, and data governance to maintain the reliability and integrity of the data.

Data scientists use the data infrastructure created by data engineers to perform advanced analytics, develop predictive models, and derive insights from the data. They work on data preparation, data exploration, and data analysis to gain a deep understanding of the data and to identify patterns, trends, and correlations. Data scientists use statistical and machine learning techniques to build models that can make predictions and solve complex problems.

The collaboration between data engineers and data scientists is essential in many ways. Data engineers need to understand the data requirements of data scientists to ensure that the data infrastructure they create is fit for purpose. Data scientists need to communicate their data requirements to data engineers to ensure that the data they receive is of high quality and meets their needs. Data scientists also rely on data engineers to maintain and update the data infrastructure to ensure that it remains reliable and secure.

In summary, data engineers and data scientists have a symbiotic relationship where they rely on each other's expertise to ensure the success of data-driven projects. Data engineers create and maintain the data infrastructure, while data scientists use it to perform advanced analytics and derive insights from the data.
